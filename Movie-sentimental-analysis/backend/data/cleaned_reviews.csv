The Old Guard,beginning movie very interesting but when approaching mid section cliche comes around all forced drama excess sad dialogues forcing dramatic life blablabla so lazy almost gave upthe worst part ingenuity characters lived like 200 years makes no sense dude 200 years old just make decision boy 15 years old after all action scenes worth saturday nights movie oh almost forgot new member team looks empty we dont get real felling her also doesnt act like girl armylike story shows up,5

The Old Guard,im stunned how can topic exciting executed boringly its dull movie camera work scenery editing uninspired already kindest word i can think setup takes way long actors have very little work go watch highlander instead,4
The Old Guard,film based comic book similarities r inevitable but solid action thriller short summary small group centuries old soldiers who r trapped immortality ability heal themselves must save each other being caged big pharma companies they soon realize harder hide 21st century so must get organized erase their footprints but same time deal past grievances,8
The Old Guard,cinematography n editing r top notch there no shaky cam darkly shot scenes hand hand combat n gun fight sequences r noteworthy charlize theron awesome shape all other actors gave good performances another highlight music,1

The Kissing Booth,movie extremely cliched but what i would expect movie nature so i enjoyed anyway what i didnt expect me have such strong hope young girls men watch learn one reason i gave movie 8 stars not because acting pretty good but because signals clarity communication relationships important,8
The Kissing Booth,if you want experience fifteen year old girls fantasy like kind acting even pretty good given writing clumsy,8
The Kissing Booth,girl doing her best performing well possible under duress pressure dating competitive but she doing her best all she has she isnt sexiest babe but flaunts just little attract man,7
The Kissing Booth,wasfun watch setting fun oriented two teens girl getting lot attention her hunk many inferior suitors come girl but she rarely dazzled weak men positive message,1
The Kissing Booth,full lovely scenes lines messages movie portrays uplifting young girls guy ignores you but its okay because he popular then you get go date him you win him because thats what you want main guy strong powerful alpha male borderline sexy only slightly disappointing factor relationship between best friends,8

The Kissing Booth,not old peoples movie adventure quite innocent what coming age movie has both nostalgia strong gender roles one can beautiful strong same time one can girl school love same time one should not ashamed human body so good film,10

Clueless,director amy heckerling knows thing two about high school flicks having directed highly successful fast times ridgemont high heckerling put her talents work thirteen years later next generation high schoolers writing directing hilarious satire life beverly hills hs heckerling takes different approach fast times which found its comedy absurdity reality depicting situations into which teenagers really get themselves here heckerlings comedy mostly comes mocking superficiality high school incrowd while not first time has been done few have ever done such blistering wit film became standard spate 1990s high school flicks set west coast borrowed many its elements,8
Clueless,story focuses cher horowitz alicia silverstone who most popular girl beverly hills hs cher seems superficial airhead but belies her conniving manipulative skills getting what she wants superficial yes airhead no plot derived part jane austens emma cher works behind scenes arrange love matches between various students she even orchestrates relationship between two teachers improve their moods so they dont grade so harshly like emma she master love everyone but herself,9
Clueless,heckerling does fantastic job presenting what seems surface cotton candy story lightweight characters but really runs much deeper revealing subtle truths about human nature her direction fledgling cast superb milking every ounce comedy out each scene,6
Clueless,silverstone sparkles role which probably not far reality which she very familiar she actually attended beverly hills hs costar breckin meyer although she didnt graduate due career commitments she received ged film catapulted her teen prominence two mtv movie awards american comedy award funniest actress leading role she plays cher both arrogance vulnerability her comic timing impeccable she also has knack physical comedy broad range contorted facial expressions amusing use body language rest teen cast also great especially brittany murphy tai breckin meyer travis dan hedaya also priceless chers work obsessed attorney father,7
Clueless,film easy like light funny spoof but still has nuance i rated 810 those who enjoy high school comedies required viewing,8
Clueless,isnt my house classic columns date all way back 1972,8
Clueless,when romantic highschool comedy clueless 1995 released immediately vaulted into cultstatus firmly stapled one most original teenflicks 1990s original perhaps term wrongly applied since based queen romance jane austens emma 1815 but what clueless did update classic story coating high school drama teenage girls shopping sprinkle heavy doses humour,10
Clueless,emma no longer emma she cher alicia silverstone spoiled rich girl walking around her beverly hills mansion bubble stereotypes teenclichés but great big heart so bighearted fact she takes lost goofy new girl her school find her love popularity knowing fullwell could destroy her own reputation clueless thus sees cher her best friend dionne stacey dash mission do good real good,8
Clueless,all detours mission entail captured brilliantly film taking form loveinterests parties shopping misunderstandings chers grumpy lawyerfather hilarious dan hedaya her nerdy stepbrother likable paul rudd her eccentric group friends school clueless superb ride teenage comedy camp only just over 10 years old still extremely dated today but no matter because 90s clichés like skateboarding marky mark catchphrase if just make so much more contemporary fun watch,6
Clueless,what elevates clueless 1995 above generic high school comedy its use stereotypes most films they unintentionally there create subconscious effect but clueless they made fun much higher degree they overblown glorious brutally satirizes rich kids their problems juxtaposes them classic heartfelt lovestory kind only jane austen can write,7
Clueless,10sep,7

Clueless,but movie works really dumbed down scale too lets face not everyone big english literature movie has awesome soundtrack paul rudd unbelievably cute mr knightly rather josh my boyfriend leads me believe same true alicia silverstone who still sparkles 10 years later midnineties teen queen good intentions cher her performance here impossible not warm too unless you have some sort grudge against valley girls inwhich case you might not like so much seriously though film must see anyone who likes some real quality comedy im so fond film personally i would suspect basically everyone would enjoy,9
Clueless,cher high school virgin who nonetheless professes all matters love relationship fashion even wades into her fathers law practice she named after former singer who now does infomercials,9

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",yeah its just movie most people arent deep philosophical movie characters can afford but if some unrealistic complexity sometimes even wisdom simple people could make some real regular people other side screen stop think over their own real regular ways maybe thats exactly what we need time time because life still here so multiple choices gives which road choose today we can still decide along way,9

Doctor Sleep,finally got see my most anticipated film year im happy tell you its everything i wished more flanagan has done amazing job adapting book stephen king giving lovers kubrick film adaptation shining 1980 cinematic sequel now i read book while i enjoyed most part i found parts underwhelming i feel film adaptation flanagan takes elements novel manages make them more darker serious which turn really helped address some issues i had book he does make some serious changes though while i embraced them im not sure how others who read book will feel about them shining 1980 me im sure lot you masterpiece filmmaking i one prefer over novel film most certainly feels like sequel stanley kubricks version love letter film last 30 mins so absolutely amazing kudos flanagan pulling off ewan mcgregor does great job adult danny torrance rebecca ferguson captivates rose hat film sets great tone some stunning visuals score completely grabs you how much you enjoy film really depends what you want out theres practically no gore here no cheap jump scares what youll get though expert filmmaking someone who you can tell really loves source material hes pulling all everything struck balance me i tremendously pleased top horror film year,9
Doctor Sleep,rating 1010 clue dreams finally i watched good movie after almost 2 months i went see movie mind you i had not read any reviews much less have seen any trailers i shocked how good movie wasthis movie really amazing great cinematograpy great acting performance great cgi effects thanks mike flanagan stephen king making kind movie i strongly suggest you guys go watch biggest screen you can get i am sure you wont regret what you pay i really liked shine abra stone shine,10
Doctor Sleep,everbeautiful rebecca ferguson favorite fargo series zahn mcclarnon team up bring us some somewhat scary but more so eeriecreepy moments adaptation kings doctor sleep most part help ewan mcgregor who plays alcoholic grownup version shinings danny torrence they pull off,8
Doctor Sleep,while doctor sleep rather drawnout mostly slowishmoving film still has enough not lose ones attention storyline solid engaging although those unfamiliar book looking outright horror gore will find little satisfaction there couple scenes which can construed horrific but my opinion doctor sleep not really horror flick definition me more like intense drama about good vs evil couple welldone endoflife scenes thrown,8
Doctor Sleep,what i most enjoyed about day age where practically every story ever has already been made into movie ones plot just bit off beaten path came across slightly new original its approach while still pretty seamlessly tying wellknown classic shining,8
Doctor Sleep,if i had add one con would somewhat minor one times girl who plays abra kyliegh curran who also possesses shining who can communicate danny delivers her lines almost stonelike manner other times if she rapidly reading occurred one too many times i found took me out movie just bit,7
Doctor Sleep,while good scenes leading up ending bit predictable showdown remember good vs evil leaves little desired most part however i can live seeing rebecca ferguson saves just being king creators do their best come full circle short like entire film itself satisfyingenough where one can feel if watching time well spent,7
Doctor Sleep,if you going into film expecting straight up sequel kubrick film same horror tone youll disappointed however if you have open mind movie very well directed acted story very compelling more fantasy thriller than horror film i really like about film also does quite bit homage 1980 film but takes into new interesting direction deep underlying theme direct steven king,10
Doctor Sleep,easily one better film adaptations stephen king novel also one better films ive seen year yet again professional film critics have proven they mostly have no idea about cinema fantastic fantasy sf horror if youre fan genre youll love film ignore critics,4
Doctor Sleep,what surprise wasnt so bad actually now hear me out when i first saw previews i felt disappointed visual look film all too greentinted lacked kubrickesque framing i want film like being sequel shining after all remember i care too much about visual aesthetics these things sometimes especially when clearly supposed connect right iconic classic green tint stays throughout film much my displeasure worked great joker though but once i got what story paid attention i realized i getting invested different type film while still remembering pay huge amounts respect legacy original once you do get elements carry over kubricks film felt well earned interestingly enough they kind blend well together too eventually we delve into supernatural aspects what stephen king going after his book thats completely fine i dont mind chilling spookie once while recently ive felt done most modern day horror film tropes so its such shock me say i had good time doctor sleep,4
Doctor Sleep,progression where danny torrances character goes natural right step they go father like son kind thing i completely onboard ghost jack nicholsons presence looms strongly over story too danny fearing not follow his fathers footsteps new story elements were able grab my attention well again soon clicked what type plotmovie then worked its its own thing thats great no shining remake except some recreated imagery handled nice respect but most importantly story characters moved forwards loved what they did character rose hat what sinister yet oddly charming antagonist portrayed hypnotically rebecca ferguson hope she gets deserved credit ewan mcgregor will always obiwan me but he fantastic choice play danny he can convincingly make me believe hes got shine surprises me how positive i feel about movie its neat little companion piece classic again big props them go their own thing no force awakens if you know what i mean youll walk though memory lane here sure difference doesnt rely nostalgia tell their story actually stands its own ill say if youre big fan original then its worth taking looksie,4
Doctor Sleep,deserves good rating because besides its slightly average storyimo they still managed make me watch full 3 hours one sitting without feeling bored minute enjoying good camera work too,8
Doctor Sleep,mike flanagan gets he feels few people can translate well original tale within tale within tale you certainly cant if your heart doesnt beat soundtrack you dont feel those happy goosebumps several times during film then history lost you after seeing movie you may have awakening sorts see worlds periphery new lightwith details you may not have noticed before least thats what i hope every person who gets chance enjoy truly unique amazing cinematic experience,8
Doctor Sleep,regardless what stephen king thinks about kubrick adaptation shining still fondly remembered movie lovers everywhere new movie however praised king being worthy adaptation his novel manages fail where kubrick succeeded its more slightly serious take superhero movie than horror movie,6
Doctor Sleep,there absolutely nothing scary about movie not even few jumpscares tries pull successful worst all everything seemed enigmatic mysterious kubricks shining quickly explained away dealt,8
Doctor Sleep,end its very inyourface movie about learning deal your own fears traumas even issues inheritedcaused ones family rather than horror movie will leave you puzzling over meaning things human nature every single horror element fully explained every mystery revealed every simple analogy spelled out you nothing left imagination even very shining first movie otherworldly awareness very few people had turned into xmen mutantsuperherolike powers one oh reason some people have shining fight evil whole great power comes great responsibility thing again its laughable american culture completely obsessed superhero narrative late its seeping into what some deem psychological horror yet seems people too dazzled state things notice choose instead just take perceive fine,5
Doctor Sleep,almost four decades ago stanley kubricks shining not only terrorized audiences but also sparked plenty unique reflection analysis its remarkable use suspense both cinematic device tool fostering character development its protagonist jack torrance films impeccable attention detail has also ensured still studied wellrespected today huge fan kubrick film well ewan mcgregor i really excited doctor sleep but unfortunately i found huge letdown,8
Doctor Sleep,plot sequel centers around adult danny torrance mcgregor working clinic new england while also trying deal severe drinking problem he must work defeat evil cult called true knot led rose hat after 12yearold girl who also has powers shining gets its crosshairs i never expecting film top genius kubrick but mike flanagan seems like talented director who wanted really honor source material so i hoping least try meaningful,3
Doctor Sleep,first major problem film its tedium while pace shining slow slow great way slowburn build up maximum suspense dramatic tension other hand doctor sleep just feels tedious large stretches film pass virtually no keyp lot character development not explored other scenes film feels repetitive like its going nowhere after while until we get close climax film also lacks genuine suspense tension original since tediousness impedes any sense impending dread i also feel more sprawling narrative story opposed shining may have been somewhat detrimental its sense tension also lacks psychological fear shining even though true knot its followers creepy attempts build up real sense terror around them generally fall flat ewan mcgregor tried his best but his performance unfortunately rather bland very limited range only real positive movie its fun see overlook hotel again but climax still doesnt feel fully satisfying not recommended 410,4
Doctor Sleep,its probably kings fault but bland story never seems find its footing while slowly building up excuse go visit overlook hotel,5
Doctor Sleep,ewan mcgregor feels oddly miscast barely moved anything happens so making us not care about anything either while most cast there just stand talk theres awkward amount standing movie lonely highlight rebecca ferguson very animated throwing everything kitchen sink elevate dull proceedings but she only gets so far,8
Doctor Sleep,when action eventually returns hotel last act barely connects anything happened earlier apparently only there so they could recreate sets scenes shining but everything so poorly written shining throwbacks come across dumb pointless draining original story rather than taking further,4
Doctor Sleep,while i dont consider masterpiece i did enjoy classic kubrick rendition shining i understand why has fan base does seeing trailer doctor sleep discovering ewan mcgregor playing adult danny torrance i thought concept might interesting,6
Doctor Sleep,everyone acts fantastic film i thought ewan mcgregor built very nice character if i had imagined how danny might have turned out after first film ended i dont think i would have predicted much different there few intense moments villains primarily rose hat snakebite andi made me absolutely hate them which good thing i think things they do film would make anyone want them see terrible fate,3

Relic,ive been awaiting arrival film ever since watching trailer few weeks ago had depth darkness feeling realness i look good horror film relic explores subject dementia unique fashion will pull your heart strings especially those have dealt illness first hand,8
Relic,relic essentially drama which disguises itself horror film using few classic horror conventions clichés metaphors provide real horror here,6
Relic,three main actors do great job conveying story deliver wonderful performance will leave you emotionally gripped throughout where relic lacks pace times can rather dull long winded only finally picks up last 13rd film,10
Relic,climax film will have you edge your seat easily best part film those dont like thought provoking symbolic conclusions will probably want stay clear one still its one more memorable endings film ive seen while undoubtedly uncomfortable,2
Relic,one worth runtime just brilliant score ambiance composition you definitely need decent pair headphones nice sound system get most out one film very dark visually can hard make out specific details most scenes obviously done expand creepy unpredictable atmosphere but if anything makes film seem duller,6
Relic,its not 1010 movie any means but does serve mildly entertaining way pass hour half time especially if you dont have anything else do watch give go you may like,4
Relic,my retrospective one sometimes you have discard old version person you knew learn love them what theyve become,1
Relic,another one these films where most reviews here say lot more about reviewer than film,8

Relic,its so rare anyone uses horror genre tell you something you needed know about life im absolutely overwhelmed how elegantly film horrified me how totally drew me work being done cast,1
Relic,really beautiful touching absolutely terrifying movie hit me across nearly every note my gosh worth watch,6
Relic,im literally going through family member really made me think what she goes through everyday its scary more thriller than horror movie but i liked all people giving crappy rating not explaining explained just over your head they stepped into what she seeing every rotted piece another memory forgotten walls closing her mind way she saw her home now symbolism people symbolism i wouldnt say 1010 but did shine light ugliness waits some us,10
Relic,honestly couldnt see half what going greatly overrated which sad because i love good australian movie,4
Relic,here we go againanother attempt slow burn horror but only thing burnt out my patience i mean its one thing if after all build up made suspense we would actually get some genuine scares but here just not there nothing nada not single moment fear,3
Relic,end day movie can look good have fine actors possess decent story but would nothing without actually horror which turns out title genre,7

The Outpost,i did two combat deployments afghanistan one iraq i can tell you without doubt movie most accurate representation fobcop life soldier lingo extent combat,10
The Outpost,most reviews ive read complain subpar dialogue not clear story what going prior attack but i bet most reviews were people who have never been war war dialogue between soldiers not interesting its dark unfiltered usually disgusting we degrade each other fight each other we say things so offensive disgusting most people would think we have issues war you also dont always have clear cut mission you can make into some grand hollywood story when you deploy you supposed find bad guys help locals thats those hoping war has some interesting story will disappointed you sit around bored exhausted missing home working out eating garbage food piss tubesbottles first movie ive seen showed bottles burn your own crap watch movies go patrol maybe get shot every so often you get big mission where combat gets intense then its rinse repeat thats how im sure prior attack thats how life keating movie depicts life military so accurately i like my gosh finally someone did they got right so anyone reading real youll find until something else made all those who talk smack about idiot keyboard warriors,8
The Outpost,combat itself good explosions look real even cgi ones were ok none dumb fireball explosion crap dust smoke generated shooting explosions point soldiers movie were coughing legit now i wasnt battle but ive been my fair share fights i can tell you tracer rounds arent fruitful you see here most time you get shot have no idea where came except maybe general direction muzzle flashes also hard see unless its night you could see them all over movie usually you just see dust smoke where they shot not flashes but hollywood has do effect does makes firefights look cool without seeing tracer bullets whiz takes away intensity also soldiers were able yell talk each other long distances yea doesnt happen war ungodly loud you have screaming dudes ear hear you when air support showed up finally how being controlled didnt make sense but thats just me being nit picky not many people know what hell going tactics were decent you could tell there some military advising sure but some things didnt make sense not sure if thats how happened just hollywood though,8
The Outpost,overall if you want watch most realistic depiction how war afghanistan all naysayers saying garbage hate way soldiers talk each other wish there more clear storymission you obviously have never been there,8
The Outpost,rip all fallen battle,9
The Outpost,premise outpost depicts battle outpost keating known battle kamdesh which took place october 3rd 2009 close border pakistan afghanistan outpost itself located bend river valley completely overlooked high mountains all sides simply put nigntmare defend prime target over run so would 300 taliban fighters would attempt do just over two fateful days october addition harsh terrain location had other issues helicopter resupply extremely challenging dangerous could only conducted night previous resupply attempted killed 12 people not depicted movie meaning only night landings when there no moon were possible due nature base being located effectively bottom funnel indirect fire support artillary impossible nearest close airsupport thirty minutes away into nightmare scenario 53 american soldiers were expected defend worst position possible so stage set modern day zulu one bloodiest close quarter conflicts war afghanistan,9
The Outpost,cast casting here impressive suspiciously full children grandchildren famous actors directors jagger gibson eastwood attenborough knowing full well difficult often tell men apart uniform during depictions conflict screen we have interesting range faces most easy spot which scott eastwood proving every bit his fathers son staff sgt clint romesha he caleb landry jones both give stand out performances but rest cast solid too special mentions cory hardrict taylor john smith ever dependable jack kesy senior officers played milo gibson whose making good name himself despite challenge having fill size 22 shoes orlando bloom who appears have come full circle playing pfc blackburn blackhawk down playing captain keating here whom camp ultimately named after number younger british actors do incredibly well even producer johnathan yunger gets action,9
The Outpost,production film predominantly shot bulgaria you would expect film being produced millenium pictures but set up camp convincing adequately conveys issues facing defenders although depiction terrain slightly different first half film tells story various officers who were stationed camp before leaving final third film depict battle here where exsoldier turned director rod lurie dop lorenzo senatore do superb job giving us balls wall depiction final assault place you firmly middle making me regret i could not have experienced sequence big screen several long takes all rage these days give very realistic depiction following one character battle then another they also employ clever techique depicting deaths real personnel involved seen primarily form third person which felt like sensible sensitive approach issue question one most dependable sargeants wounded early during firefight which has impact battle morale soldiers whom find themselves fighting their lives minute minute enough screen time given depicting local political problems facing american officers who did their best under extremely challenging circumstances placate locals,8
The Outpost,overall film one best depictions close quarter fighting since blackhawk down extremely well handled some earlier dialogue between soldiers lets film down little bit yes we know soldiers do talk like time time but some lines cringeworthy say least i am sure dialogue could have easily been improved upon but minor gripes aside film pretty gripping depiction stupid military blunder which cost lives several young men completely unnecessarily does seem shame however release film may have torpedoed second film subject red platoon based book written medal honour winner clinton romesha played scott eastwood eastwood not able speak romesha when researching role he depicted due conflict which feels real shame so possible we might see second film depicting battle bring,8
The Outpost,very much mold zulu 1964 love realism being real war ammunition bombs going off left right center soldiers forced extreme survival skills battle incredible odds some fort surrounded all sides mountains outpost 100 certified feministfree guy popcornmovie going give 7 but light think ill give 8,9
The Outpost,great movie indeed there but there couple great things about,8
The Outpost,follows similar line 13 hours secret soldiers benghazi which i liked lot too storytelling around lives each soldier built differently but goal here not explore lives each them but understand challenges fighting war place clearly indefensible there no protections against mountains everyone knows even viewer you get first glimpse environment soldiers were put,9
The Outpost,i recommend movie i think you will like if you also like movie based true events,10
The Outpost,very accurately captures how soldiers interact one another trailer worried me few hollywood sounding oneliners but dialogue action sequences genuine experience make very authentic i really enjoy how film highlights various leadership styles approaches those command great film i hope gets more attention 910,9
The Outpost,i thought would b movie but actually really good truly intense brings you outpost where you feel threatened desperate i really enjoyed,7
The Outpost,there few warfilm cliches but doesnt make those scenes unrealistic rest nonsoldier very real i dont see how could have been done better actors go allout direction taut action almost nonstop effects convincing well worth watch if subject doesnt simply depress you too much,10
The Outpost,very well made some soldiers were battle participated actors giving even more realism all actors did amazing job they made me stick my eyes screen not blink until movie over sound engineering insanely good well postproduction editing i will not spoil battle anyone reading but i can say my heart pumping like i there great job,8
The Outpost,i dont understand how movie has less than 7 stars also why garbage insignificant woke movies have same rating one wake up,7
The Outpost,i waited while before i watched due negative reviews internet but after seen i just dont understand thise people,10
The Outpost,okay maybe its slow beginning theres lot scenes you think well why how please explain but once things go wrong outpost hell movie,7
The Outpost,scott eastwood dark his eyes voice really lik eclint said back flick based true events cruelty war shown friendship death so close effects just edge goredom,10
The Outpost,if you can sit throughout first 45 minutes then really good movie,7
The Outpost,gore 15 nudity 05 effects 35 story 55 comedy 05,10
The Outpost,movie despite its occasional poor reviews fantastic film basis movie does great job introducing you characters youd want learn true story i read book clinton romesha depicted scott eastwood last year entitled red platoon always had interest learning more about events unfolded day movie my opinion did book justice far filmography concerned great realistic action gunfire explosions etc youd expect see war movie added aspect realism trauma you can see actors portrayal their characters eyes can only glimpse into what they experienced watch movie read book viceversa just remember names,10
The Silencing,reviews here being far too kind whilst has interesting premise film just bungles along has far too many plot holes characters making absurd choices,4
The Silencing,writing pretty bad annabelle wallis performance seriously phoned times just bad reveal killer serious let down motive just not believable all,5
The Silencing,scenery nice but cinematography very uninspired very low budget looking give one miss,6
The Silencing,so yeah movie actually pretty engaging its backed amazing backdrop solid performance nikolaj however movie far being unforgettable let down cliched climax last 1520 mins movie makes its feel like its just another serial killer movie movie lacked originality some point had resort way serial killer movie would usually go people who fond genre could enjoy watching movie without any expectation once,6
The Silencing,everything about movie okay story characters etc all okay none bad but none fantastic either does bare minimum good movie should do good acting good writing good pacing good filming good editing technical movie 101 perspective everything textbook doesnt make any huge mistakes,6
The Silencing,however where movie prevents itself being very good following two things,7
The Silencing,1 ruins one very good opportunity turns into pointless plot device midway through discovery made which raises stakes tremendously point film could have done something very good but end its rendered useless plot jumps onto something else villain emerges very unconvincing motive,5
The Silencing,2 its carboncopy much better movie called wind river 2017 i couldnt help but notice similar lookfeel within first few minutes setting music how story opens very similar much my disappointment borrowing ideas didnt stop there rest movie practically same so if i could recommend one thing go watch other movie wind river instead wind river everything movie wishes could every department movie fantastic,8
The Silencing,solid 6 star film not great not terrible dragged little here there but still watchable,7
The Silencing,i love murder mysteries movies dont give away plot early so one actually good i didnt figure out close end acting 610 plot writing also 610 thats why i gave 610 rating i find when story has good character building really gives you good background into why things happen storybut wasnt developed enough me sheriff played alice gustafson male lead nikolaj costerwaldau rayburn swanson did great job id recommend good watch nothing more then,6
The Silencing,you can definitely tell writer director were heavily influenced true detective series particular film which good thing imo visual style thematics plotting aspects executed similar fashion show overall story relatively run mill far murder mystery seeking revenge tracking down killer still stays interesting enough never gets too stale enough intensity suspense keep attention actors all decent keep level intrigue throughout also some very well done cinematography fantastic scenerysettings there some moments seem tad cliché like big reveal towards end but overall does what needs basic thriller,8
The Silencing,nice movie well performed filmed directed writing needs more depth some characters less others too much expectation created around main guy beeing great hunter nothing woman being sheriff just shoot civilian without any consecuence all uhmmmmbesides entertainig constant drinking didnt added much either because missused,4
The Silencing,silencing had all things i love film had unexpected moments sprinkled throughout lead character i liked wanted alright end whodunnit element some twists what more could you ask thriller type movie coming out every week back 90s they were all great yet these days youre lucky if you get one every couple months theyre not usually good they used so when i come across one well done film rare treat,4
The Silencing,nikolaj costerwaldau game thrones plays lead role he remarkably good leadman not only he naturally likeable but he also very easy sympathise his character has had something awful happen him so he has become alcohol can quite unpleasant his exwifes husband example sometimes these characters can very hard get onboard if theyre played wrong actor but case i happy look past his flaws get onside him,6
The Silencing,mentioned earlier i really like good whodunnit theyre incredibly out fashion these days unfortunately but silencing great reminder how well they can work cinema i really enjoyed movie would highly recommend people give watch,4
The Silencing,decent directing excellent cinematography but writing needed more oomph more cohesive plot less plot holes technical issues good watch but nothing spectacular wouldve been better short film 93 min runtime slow pacing made film feel much longer,7
The Silencing,its always interesting see what stars big beloved shows do after their characters leave when show ends sometimes manner thats anything but beloved yes benioff weiss so thriller nikolaj costerwaldau game thrones annabelle wallis peaky blinders anticipated intrigue setting plot topped cake off cherry so silencing quite decent thriller never reached stars pales considerably front its spiritual similars perhaps inspirations true detective wind river etc but no aspect really movie below average,9
The Silencing,nikolaj portrays rayburn swanson reformed hunter living solitude wildlife sanctuary troubled deeply disappearance his daughter years ago deadly game cat mouse ensues he town sheriff alice annabelle wallis set out track down newly active serial killer who may have also kidnapped rayburns daughter story provides most what one would expect chases clues violence investigative other misconceptions offering also some minor plot turns could raise couple eyebrows though serious working heavy themes silencing lacks suspense atmosphere couldve been plot largely functions familiar tropes leads rather clichéd final act where first feature screenplay micah ranum doesnt realize its full potential performances geographical backdrop visual work tries their best make up i took some issue character alice annabelle wallis didnt have whole lot shine whereas nikolajs offering rayburn felt like most fulfilled character acting performance within silencing shot ontario canada silencing utilizes landscapes small towns drab charms well though backdrop eventually plays role smaller than id wish see cinematographys solid if not exactly impressive though throughout i thinking itd do better little less greys color grading,5
The Silencing,silencing feels lesser than shouldve been but its never bad truly boring decent but forgettable lands middle one those many movies feel disappointing not being disappointing fans rural thrillers devious small town shenanigans serial killer mysteries should able find kick two silencing my rating 610,4
The Silencing,definitely worth watch im very picky viewer if film doesnt grab me first 10 minutes then ill quickly turn off im happy report kept interested full nearly 90 minute run time which perfect length picture like imho,2
The Silencing,jaime lannister once again did not disappoint i thoroughly enjoyed shot caller so i figured id give try well im glad i did couple decent plot twists along good performances all actors decent script held picture together quite well,1
The Silencing,its far oscar worthy but its also slightly above straight dvd 1 store trash bin just decent little thriller should hold your attention 90 minutes i recommend,8
The Silencing,clone better movie really wind river much more interesting better paced watch,9
The Silencing,interesting setting okay cast just needed little improvement writing,10
The Silencing,ive seen better movies subjecttopic because there too many inconsistencies loud screams ludocrisity done caracters plot superindependent sheriff does lonesome ride everywhere danger parkkeepers lack will communicating police others dire situations wt cell might have given some truthfulness working not simple houseline phone better its also hard understand police juristictions way law enforcement dealt just becomes deadwater where there no push found,6
Joker,i person saw all hype claims masterpiece overreacting overblown excitement another joker based film i thought looked solid best even bit too pretentious trailer but here say i incredibly wrong massive achievement cinema thats extremely rare day age cgi nonsense reboots while somewhat reboot sorts standalone origin tale impeccable start finish echoes resemblance best joker origin comics past joaquin bleeds sweats cries his every drop into magnificently dedicated performance heath ledger would proud undoubtedly greatest acting performance since heaths joker directing writing slickly brilliant bleak settings tones palpable throughout when film over place blown away every audience member awestruck they witnessed film could still transport them into characters world very existence believe hype going revered transcending masterpiece cinema,10
Joker,every once while movie comes truly makes impact joaquins performance scenography all its brilliance grotesque haunting cringy hard watch times but so mesmerizing you wont blink eye watching tragic but seriously funny moments emotional rollercoaster sometimes multiple emotions poppingup same time,10
Joker,far typical actionriddled predictable superhero movie its proper psychological thrillerdrama single best character development i have ever seen,10
Joker,movie only those who have felt alone isolated can truly relate you understand motive you feel sorry character lot people will see movie think encourages violence but truly movie should encourage each every one us become better person treat everyone respect make each other feel like they belong world instead making them feel isolated,10
Joker,truly masterpiece best hollywood film 2019 one best films decade truly best film bring comic book so chillingly realistically real ife remarkable direction cinematography music acting some people surprised find disturbing violent but its necessity message its about society reflects those underappreciatedunrecognizedbullied people proving they can do something too way shows class difference corruption how rich talented rule others around them not exaggerated thats what makes different its believable there could multiple jokers living our society could shake those around them much bitter way than film shows making people uncomforting people consider wake up call message but first film perfect film,10
Joker,joaquin phoenix gives tour de force performance fearless stunning its emotional depth physicality its impossible talk about without referencing heath ledgers oscarwinning performance dark knight widely considered definitive liveaction portrayal joker so lets talk about fact everyone going stunned what phoenix accomplishes because its what many thought impossible portrayal matches potentially exceeds dark knights clown prince crime,10
Joker,most time movies anticipated like they end up falling short way short joker first time i more than happy hype please ignore complaints pernicious violence they embarrassing say least we havent seen comic movie real before if we ever deserved better class criminal phillips phoenix have delivered dark joker dark you will fall love villain you should bad guys always more romantic anyway,10
Joker,let me start off saying if joaquin phoneix doesnt get his oscar movie then oscars should cancelled phoneix amazing you mightve heard every review ever but todd phillips his best here story lines he takes visuals just breathtaking score omg score every time score came i felt very uncomfortable like something horrible about happen great inspirations taxi driver king comedy there add so much movie i got honest there scenes very violent its disturbing but i honestly expected wayyyy more violent all controversy going overall movie great come oscar season needs nominated best picture screenplay cinematography actor score director,10
Joker,i get why some people hate its because political message how some people think you need get empathy arthurs madness but come not point will never enjoy masterpiece because joaquin phoenix todd phillips overdid themselves movie actingmusic cinematography just amazing please enjoy movie without overthinking,10
Joker,i have seen joker yesterday venice early illfated screening we had some trouble audio lead nearhour delay but definitely worth,10
Joker,joker deserved presented venice film festival event regards cinema form art because film far blockbuster mere entertainer movie most films genre,10
Joker,focuses psyche main character slowly crumbles under pressure society thus joaquin phoenix does wonderful performance earning almost surely nomination oscars least its take joker differs ledgers but id say both equally good main difference might ledgers joker rational acts insane while phoenixs insane root,7
Joker,despite being movie about superhero villain joker much superior most movies genre id exclude dark knight trilogy only but joker easily good nolans movies least very close smallscaled film distinct style cinematography cannot but appreciated set very cinephile references however do not feel too forced overly opressive most notable similarities scorseses taxi driver his king comedy but also chaplins modern times somewhat referenced,10
Joker,i am eager see more noncomedic efforts todd phillips movie so far probably best 2019 worst contested so far only dolor y gloria once upon time hollywood should very convincing,9
Joker,its sad joaquin missed oscar gladiator he very compelling villain but i am quite confident he will win joker damn what movie keeps u toes all time unpredictable storyline really deep interesting plot did i forget mention acting damn do niro joaquin teach u what really 5 star acting enjoy movie get wine your hand close curtains turn ur cellphones put do not disturb sign ur door best dark thriller suspense movie you will get experience,10
Joker,i have just watched joker venice i will say if joaquin doesnt get oscar year then something wrong world perfomance just jawdropping glues you screen doesnt let go till end story very good has some interesting connections batman loreespecially one you cant guess trailers there some scenes so tense wellacted imaginative push movie 10 cinematography direction great todd has proven himself director robert also good his small role will definitely see again soon out october,10
Joker,there no doubt movie well thought plot execution i must praise phoenixs superb acting he managed portray very believably awkward social reject also crazy murderer he became i really think its role only few could do also very interesting watch how he deteriorated mentally little little gave up trying fit into society gotta hand script writer plot unpredictable,10
Joker,but,10
Joker,there wasnt anything too complex about arthurs mental state no deep psychological analysis web many deep factors created one kind psychotic maniac could i expecting too much very possible since i came very high expectations after reading some reviews what doesnt have anything expectations end he didnt remind much original joker he felt more like simply society reject went completely crazy started killing people not much different many other serial killers mass murderers he didnt have master mind so much designated joker made him different simple murderer,9
Joker,another thing there were long parts movie felt very dull also i found hard buy reason behind riots city role joker played them even if taken into account poverty anger cooking long time society still feels somewhat absurd killing three people subway made joker so notorious,6
Joker,conclusion i can identify character which gave me lasting impression movie movie could have been very great if movie about how person thats rejected society turns slowly into serial killer but movie about joker i felt lacking lacking things made joker actually joker not just another crazy murderer,7
Joker,movie causes audience consider many topics morality particularly poor choices made joker joker more relatable movie than antagonists usually i think gives more realistic view bad people who not usually 100 bad all ways society often judges important know when sympathize joker towards beginning movie when he needs identified threat when he begins making certain bad choices movie only suitable adults who willing pick apart think critically about isnt light amusement substance what makes so good,7
Joker,if you arent able ponder underlying themes your own you have handed all your thoughts you then isnt best movie you,9
Joker,movie affects you way makes physically painful experience but good way,7
Joker,acting cinematography sound design script itself phenomenal movie triumph joaquin pheonix deserves oscar win tbh,5
Avengers: Endgame,there no way i could describe my emotions movie im totally speechless i havent laughed even cried much marvel movie even any movie im fully my emotion there so many tears joy loss amazing story acting outstanding epic action great cgi best storytelling ever told superhero movie amazing performance i love more than 3000,10
Avengers: Endgame,happiness sadness pure joy excitement im gonna miss moment my whole life because lets face its been awhile movies can bring such big enthusiasm like,6
Avengers: Endgame,such experience youll gonna remember forever people clapping laughing crying full state emotion its 3 hours long but went like finger snapping thanos now im thinking im actually quantum realm because felt like 5 seconds even though you know where story gonna bring you because its still superhero movie but left me speechless its not just superhero movie its more than,10
Avengers: Endgame,spoiler alert,10
Avengers: Endgame,even some characters you didnt like before you will love them movie like captain marvel i didnt like her before her own movie but endgame they showed how powerful how strong how capable she really now i kinda love her but marvel should really careful her line though i didnt like some her line like im strongest you didnt win because before you didnt have me duh also not gonna forget hawkeye honest avengers i really didnt like hawkeye because hes just guy arrow just randomly showed up any scene but actually hes character so badass everything we need what we want here,6
Avengers: Endgame,also i dont get why some people can not accept thor fat treat him like joke i mean movie might trying give us message about no matter what shape you you can hero save world honest i like what they did thor man depressed taking most responsible after he missed shot kill thanos infinity war even though he already did killed him but its not gonna bring back his people asgard also hes god thunder god sake he could slap his stomach thunder got his abs back,4
Avengers: Endgame,im so happy too captain america finally he could do his dance peggy i didnt expected we could see fight between captain america his own self also when tony met his father really warm my heart we can see reallife jarvis i didnt expected too,6
Avengers: Endgame,when whole superhero arrived so epic whole person theater screaming shocked gives me goosebumps still left me speechless,3
Avengers: Endgame,movie absolute perfection ending movie we characters deserved gives perfect balance all these past 10 years epic perfect ending i not disappointed all movie completely emotional visually stunning now i get why russo brothers told us do marvel movie marathon before watching endgame because movie had everything accomplish what left behind before all,2
Avengers: Endgame,ready not whatever takes,2
Avengers: Endgame,go watch yourself,1
Avengers: Endgame,i have say my first reaction walking out cinema great probably 810 you know theres so much fan service movie i particularly loved i can do all day ca line one ca another almost toy story 2 enlightened buzz naive buzz banter,1
Avengers: Endgame,i loved clever hulk found thor hilarious though bit annoying times loved references past movies cap swinging mjollnir around beautiful,1
Avengers: Endgame,deaths movie were also pretty surprising but i agree some more balanced reviews here bizarre so much time spent hawkeye does anyone really care about him not really,5
Avengers: Endgame,killing off black widow surprising touch but i like many others probably felt more emotional reaction banners relationship her not hawkeye because no one actually cares about him renner actor just doesnt cut much unfortunately,1
Avengers: Endgame,real problem end game time travel i dont know why any movie franchise would ever want deal time travel knowing how much grief creates sure they try explain everything their hilarious conversation about movies but end there just too many questions left end day particularly when they already try explain through ancient one,1
Avengers: Endgame,most glaring one these if they change past theyre changing another timeline so how selfish if tony stark snaps his fingers kills thanos what happens original timeline if he sent thanos everyone back how does he magically know not send gamora back who now stuck 2023 so does mean 2014 quill never meets gamora what hell essentially erasing entire 2014 gotg franchise universe if captain america goes back time he will inevitably change history some way another so another timeline right so while everyone elses timeline meant stay same present said stark how does cap end up sitting same lake everyone else,1
Avengers: Endgame,there also way too many questions about new timelines created but perhaps intentional such loki tv show but why i hate when they bring time travel into any movie just add stuff make wrap up nicely their own universe,1
Avengers: Endgame,also dont get me started how impossibly strong thanos suddenly without infinity gauntlet even ig he couldnt stop thors stormbringer but now without ig can easily defeat thor stormbringer mjollnir iron man cap how convenient,1
Avengers: Endgame,i also think marvel made serious mistake creating captain marvel how she brought convenient deus ex machina yet doesnt really stick around show off all her abilities she cant even defeat thanos single handedly pfft rich she can barely prevent thanos snapping his fingers yet infinity war cap able actually hold off his hand too bizarre parallels,1
Avengers: Endgame,so okay sure enjoyable watch but i just feel there too many plot inconsistencies creeping into end game there should have been better ways get infinity stones back i think someone stupid just thought time travel best way do,1
Avengers: Endgame,after avengers infinity war we waited avengers endgame we wondered how story would go how our heroes would turn back what would end thanos many theories related have been put forward avengers endgame undoubtedly most anticipated film recent years normally higher expectation higher probability disappointment but not case endgame whatever youre expecting you find much more film means biggest concern about film has disappeared,1
Avengers: Endgame,other hand another comparison comes up endgame more successful than infinity war we can comfortably say avengers infinity war just beginning story endgame finale story so we shouldnt think these two films two separate stories there only one story divided into two parts,1
Avengers: Endgame,avengers endgame above all great homage tenyear history marvel cinematic universe story highlights original avengers team iron man captain america thor hulk black widow hawkeye center events no character comes front them course there many characters play important role story outside original avengers team everyones concern captain marvel who included marvel world overshadowed other heroes we can say certainly did not happen what important struggle not how strong you but how good you comes fore all areas gives good message about being hero family,1
Avengers: Endgame,course avengers endgame has some critical aspects example threehour period necessary terms story can discussed head story moves much slower than rest also drags heroes into emotional predicament then tempo rising heavy scenes we watching getting more meaningful last 45 minutes movie fully action packed but last 45 minutes goes so fast you dont even realize action battle scenes really successful there not even slight distress about visual effects there also slight logic errors film but general story so successful these details become meaningless insignificant after certain point,1
The Rental,i really wanted love hell out rental trailer looked great cast particularly dan stevens alison brie sold me fact dave franco making his feature film debut screenwriter director intrigued me i cheerleading movie good if not great,5
The Rental,but movie unfortunately only watch oncemixed bag kind flick its plot almost any lowbudget home invasion voyeuristic horror movie made last 10 years but slightly prettier package netflixs open house afraid ratter hangman 13 cameras 14 cameras if youve seen any those movies then know what expect tr,5
The Rental,i cannot fault dave francos solid directing cinematography good cast performances great see alison brie return horror genre since her appearance scream 4 dan stevens always treat but unfortunately storyline rental just too bland predictable make real mark i expected more suspense something little more memorable than something can sit crowd similar titles still seen derivative unremarkable i also didnt have best time these characters too much relationship drama not enough buildup suspense,5
The Rental,id have given 410 but ill give extra star because cast direction good production values movie overall still rental best,3
The Rental,510,1
The Rental,i wanted like movie but sadly its been done before better movies my title said cast great i think dan stevens one best actors around,5
The Rental,so my opinion just doesnt do anything new ending also poor lets hope mr franco can come back something little more original next time,5
The Rental,generic pointless anticlimactic movie fizzle out into nothingness always amazes me when people get shot making full length movie case dave franco when they dont have anything new good bring table then why even bother waste money time talent stevens brie,4
The Rental,five dead coastal massacre,2
The Rental,its movie about 4 dumb friends falling prey homicidal voyeur probably,4
The Rental,act one slowburn setup characters their situation nobody particularly interesting,7
The Rental,act two first act i know what you did last summer,5
The Rental,act three last 10 minutes movie all four main characters being hit head hammer killer setting up his scheme new location,6
The Rental,thats,5
The Rental,admittedly spooky shot someone running up stalled car trailer characters offscreen death scene seconds later very brief dark shot another character hit head hammer within couple minutes third character killed you guessed being hit head hammer if im being honest i already forgot what happens last girl i so checked out point i truly dont even care,2
The Rental,dont bother,3
The Rental,i didnt like single character movie complete waste talent characters were boring stupid selfish immature i had really high hopes movie pointless absolutely no closure i didnt care if single character lived died there soooooooo many wasted moments leave you wandering why they should have used teenagers least would have justified their stupidity,5
The Rental,when watching such films you kept glued screen because you want know whos doing all why when you find out its nameless faceless person no motive whatsoever other than being his hobbyfull time passion renders whole movie waste time,1
The Rental,many onestar reviews here provide interesting glimpse into popular taste apparently movie about psychopathy supposed end some scooby doo unmasking where crazed maniac who has just murdered entire cast unmasks himself reveals some perfectly reasonable linear motivation his behavior which upon looking back viewer will realize has been cleverly foreshadowed filmmakers all along conventionoh so thats what caused all mayhemand course its sometimes satisfying but more often than not renders film cheap tidy forgettable lengths filmmakers will go order sufficiently shock youthe red herrings duplicitous sociopath best friendsis often quite awful its been decades since i saw original bone collector movie but ill never forget my bafflement utter disappointment when big twisty reveal happened all i my companion could think who heck honestly would have been better if killer had just been random person,1
The Rental,which im pretty sure how serial murder often works idea some narrative bow going tie everything up end bloodbath well disrespectful victims unfortunate number reallife bloodbaths country bears witness sometimes people just violent deranged like watch people suffer though they probably have reasons their behavior behavior probably has little nothing do their victims would have made things better if you learned end rental killer caretakers brother he had been cheated his wife thats why he murdered anyone any time he witnessed sexual transgression would make okay would make their murders sensible satisfying,3
The Rental,said isnt great movie i like fresh anarchic randomness conclusion toby huss jeremy allen white standouts cast but screenplay suffers some implausible depictions psychology behaviorwhich say too often characters make choices just seem terribly stupid unnatural seems like they only do what they do because plot demands not because actual people would behave way,2
The Rental,so yes neither excellent nor awful way spend 89 minutes but anyone suggesting review more than 4 stars paid promotion has extremely narrow view what movie allowed like,3
The Rental,rental new horror thriller directed written produced dave franco first film he has directed he more known actor film world,1
The Rental,film brothers charlie dan stevens josh jeremy allen white decide go weekend trip their friends they have found perfect house online sea trying make pleasant weekend they only suspect their landlord somewhat racist towards josh his muslim girlfriend mina sheila vand despite mistrust four try make fun weekend but during time together they get know each other better than they expected how their mutual relationships tested when charlie discovers theyve been secretly filmed all weekend he must choose find hidden footage confess what he secretly did over weekend,1
The Rental,dave franco has portrayed film his first directed film but he has also taken bit too much hay partly writing producing film taking all these different tasks he still struggles convey film clearly one point movie almost comes across long episode temptation island turns more into teen drama than horror thriller aspect comes fore without further explanation due these unclear sudden changes genre film can come across tedious,1
Midway,if you want bypass quibbles get straight meat review please skip my last paragraph,10
Midway,battle midway story thats well known most annapolis graduates my generation earlier battle key inflection point world war ii perhaps pivotal moment changing course pacific war,8
Midway,although i loved seeing henry fonda nimitz 1976 version midway fonda play nimitz harms way well unfortunately i found movie surprisingly dull historically inaccurate unnecessarily melodramatic generally not very good,9
Midway,because my experience more recent movie renderings historical subjects usually dont improve historical accuracy im thinking 2001s godawful ben affleck pearl harbor visàvis 1970s tora tora tora i did not have high hopes new midway,5
Midway,i wrong,5
Midway,short midway terrific movie not only does get history mostly right its tight elegant superb rendering does historical figures proud succeeds pack way more into its 2 hour 18 minute run length than you can imagine covers attack pearl harbor pacfltwashington tension dynamic nimitzs ascension command pacific lcdr laytons contribution intelligence picture joe rocheforts robewearing genius yamamotos soulsearching halseys tenacity ascendency naval aviation tiny bit submarine contributions battle andoh yeahthe actual battle itself include incredible unbelievable jawdropping but true heroism our yorktown enterprise naval aviators does all justice superb bit moviemaking,10
Midway,can 26year navy veteran like me find nits pick course,10
Midway,but good stuff way exceeds nits,8
Midway,end 2 hours flew me so good i plan seeing again next weekend what terrific way celebrate veterans day,6
Midway,course roland emmerichs prior movies have been whole simpleminded blockbusters but time he took risk doing something thoughtful respectful accurate artistic only way ensure movies like continue made public show we care about history accuracy make movie success i very much hope does well then maybe we have chance getting right movie made about indianapolis,9
Midway,final thought ive been disgusted many cynical snarky reviews written professional movie reviewers many which sneer bravery warriors depicted yes dialog movie sometimes simple tired trite few characters not well developed particularly women its perfectly appropriate reviewers criticize elements moviemaking one reviewer made fun line dialog where best says pearl harbor there nothing silly unreasonable about line you can bet one pilots actually said something like day somebody who survived 911 attack pentagon when i later went afghanistan you can bet if i had chance do so i would have said gerry deconto one my friends who didnt make out day but many these sneering reviewers have gone say readers because these weaknesses they should not see midway keep mind there were similar elements spielbergs lincoln could considered inaccurate andor overthetop moviemaking most scenes depicted congress example but whole events portrayed movie important americans understand same true here so point i want make movie can have elements poor moviemaking yet important movie viewers watch midway one such movie depicts poorly understood event american history but one americans should exposed events depicted people depicted real they really did these things bravery real americans need know reviewers who have likely never risked anything their lives should have good graces not sneer those who have,5

Midway,execution critical battle scenes main draws watch film director roland emmerich will always remembered man who brought us independence day 1996 2012 2009 course there big explosions massive destruction here well massive scenes showing fiery exploding seacraft aircraft were rendered crisp cinematography meticulous visual effects create impressive screen spectacles aviation scenes particularly dive bomber runs dick best were excellently staged shot edited elicit exhilarating rush,9
Midway,its 2 hours 18 minute run story crucial naval battles heroism its reallife protagonists were front center here midway there were no fictional characters cheesy love stories like first midway film pearl harbor while seeing some popular young actors like criss jonas can distracting allstar cast generally rendered honor respect heroes they portrayed focusing soldiers lesser rank allowed some intimate personal drama actual battle situations perhaps not much depth possible movie rated pg so do not expect see graphic injuries level saving private ryan,10
Midway,probably first time over 50 years hollywood made solid war movie without inserting sappy contrived romantic subplot pushing some radical political agenda rewriting history movie good dialogue believable natural convincingly delivered almost all cases,6
Midway,while no movie perfectly accurate historically historians dont even agree much so who say few errors here trivial immaterial how events progressed somebody who buff period early pacific war reading every book prange lord many others i very impressed,8
Midway,i went into movie expecting worst hollywood but their best historical piece generations even casting seemed echo real people looks demeanor,10
Midway,japanese point view wasnt neglected either while i cant say whether japanese dialogue believable welldelivered all outward appearances acting also top notch similarity between real admiral nagumo actor particularly striking they made right call using solid japanese actors speaking japanese,3
Midway,accurate portrayal friction between imperial navy imperial army emperor hirohito almost powerless restrain militarists very refreshing very important complex contributing factor war few outside japan some narrow historical circles ever learn about dynamic,7
Midway,about worst i can say about movie pace too fast unless stretched into 8 hour miniseries i cant imagine they could have avoided my background i could fill gaps context movie seemed miss others might left confused even though not wellread chapter history my spouse followed storyline without issue really enjoyed movie entertainment,3
Midway,kudos producers writers actors entire crew job welldone fitting tribute heroes like layton best,6
Midway,abundant notquiterealistic computergenerated images make midway look more like video game than depiction reallife events overuse subpar effects most dominant but hardly only problem dogging film epic war stories difficult tell without focusing few characters film unsuccessfully juggles too many plot threads too many characters keep emotional anchor simulated events unfolding woody harrelson outstanding but other cast members cannot overcome limitations material challenges acting computergenerated sets,10
The Fifth Element,i really believe they billed movie wrong many folks came expecting next star wars were disappointed say least its not like star wars its kinda like live action comic book visually stunning awesome use color just jumps out you nonstop action lots done tongue firmly cheek plot well forget plot its weak point film but hey who ever said comic books had have strong plots willis jovovich rest do fine job i especially like casting jovovich she exudes innocence vulnerability sex exotica intelligence kung fu machismo all same time so turn off cynicism sign you watch just enjoy ride great stuff,9
The Fifth Element,bruce willis milla jovovich star wonderful scifi tale chock full killer performances excellent effects,10
The Fifth Element,korben dallas your average ordinary new york taxi driver fresh out military unlucky love close losing his job one day ultimate fare literally falls into his lap leeloo enters his life via roof his cab leeloo seems genetically manipulated ultimate weapon against pure evil but her beauty buttkicking hide more fragile nature dallas host others will have step up help her save humanity,10
The Fifth Element,amazing scifi adventure luc leon besson has little something everyone beauty gorgeous jovovich orange hair even action gunplay excellent acting amazing visual effects romance creative sets costume design dynamic interesting music mildly annoying but funny chris tucker you name film has spades 5th element hands down one best science fiction films ever,8
The Fifth Element,ive seen many times always want more i highly recommended,8
The Fifth Element,i think fifth element movie i have seen most perfect mixture action comedy sciencefiction suspense romance set not so far future eternal battle between good evil shown us extravagant setting flying cars aeroplanes go speed light weird creatures ugly aliens only few things present during film story has never been seen before good has only one weapon defeat evil composed four stones representing four element water earth fire air perfect creature these five elements have united before forces evil arrive earth but evil has found help stones have disappeared bruce willis one best action actors our time milla jovovich ian holm gary oldman make suspense even more intense chris tucker incredibly funny ads lot comic side film story extremely imaginative my opinion one luc bessons best i have never seen anything else like costumes designed jeanpaul gaultier unbelievably imaginative fun they big part extravagance originality movie score eric serra one my favourites simply work art last but not least special effects absolutely excellent adding quality movie if you looking action good laugh film see but actors not only things make film worth seeing click here,10
The Fifth Element,fifth element complex filmif you want offers varying levels analysis depending tools you have dig surface leave your brain cloakroom scifi yarn you may well find wanting far removed star wars austin powers diamonds forever film pitched uniquely those who can laugh life but who have deep down unquenchable desire adventure romantic,10
The Fifth Element,set futuristic earth where really nothing has changed except technology bruce willis still john mclane hasbeen stormtrooper reduced now driving aircabs livingsame old premise him nothings changed much since striking distance except maybe yellow hairrinse now legend has time long long ago forces darkness visited earth were repelled unification close proximity four stones representing four elements earth wind fire water together fifth element unknown origin,8
The Fifth Element,dear old ian holm priest cornelius expert authority five elements keeper all knowledge things magical mysterious gary oldman arguably his most wayput role general zorg who has done deal dark side whose sole purpose take possession elemental stones scene wherein he demonstrates new weaponry his alien henchman which oneline summary quote above taken absolute classic cinema milla jovovich married besson time flick absolutely rivetting leeloo clonedunzipped humanised fifth element she must have practised long hard perfecting her ancient language dialogits amazing she strikes exactly right note being purity femininity warrior woman film progresses she assumes identitiy perfect girl any man would wish want protect,10
The Fifth Element,comedy angle hysterical action sequences your face fx generally impressive if not mega weird times color visuals play major role proeuropean production continent where not surprisingly most successful outcome naturally predictable best traditions will love save day if wasnt always going,8
The Fifth Element,so there u have watch onedimensionally thats what youll get back let flow immerse yourself you couldnt fail have good time unless course you clinically dead devoid any sense fun fantasy but case youd wasting your time anyway wasnt made you,7
The Fifth Element,great movie isnt your typical same alien vs human movie where there blood everywhere humans win right before theyve thought end much more interesting story has love vs evil whole new way theres lesson learned through,10
The Fifth Element,honestly i didnt really care about plot all much imagination creativity awesome i love colors ideas they came up especially how design city futuristic clothing cool too only thing i disappointed enemy aliens they looked little too artificial,10
The Fifth Element,my favorite thing about whole movie music went techno opera jazz all over i loved music partially because they used engima vangelis many people like what heck when they hear music but fits movie perfectly leaves you feeling more than theme i like randomness music works well quirkiness movie,10
The Fifth Element,fifth element another fine example filmmaking talents luc besson luc besson creative genius director classic films such big blue nikita leon professional has returned genre started his filmmaking career scifi fifth element luc besson realises his life long ambition make film based story he thought while still school zaltman bleros writing directing film he skillfully mixes humour action amazing visual effects put fifth element class its own stunning performances put forward milla jovovich bruce willis ian holm chris tucker gary oldman who returns work luc besson after playing norman stansfield leon fifth element show us how well comedy action romance can put together overlooked academy awards luc besson won cesar best director cannes 1998 fifth element simply excellent film 1010,10
The Fifth Element,after making heavy movies like la femme nikita leon somewhat departure luc besson do comic pulp scifi film fifth element looking his work now such highoctane humor transporter series among others written besson but not directed doesnt seem out place he just must have decided only direct his more serious fare leave fun stuff others however fifth element no means slight film without fan base far scifi goes very capable installment its mythology creatures action special effects movie has everything going humor thats infused just makes better vaulting through genres making accessible almost everyone who gives try,10
The Fifth Element,like most its ilk story revolves around evil force about devour earth rest life itself increases size power each influx destruction hate thrown every opportunity blow up only makes stronger through series fortunate unfortunate happenings depending who you aligning we have paths crossing priest who holds answers survival exmilitary cab driver bent having some fun excitement strange woman another place center all evil mercenary out money government galaxy trying save face front inevitable extermination good versus evil traveling through space order either shed light death out universe victory,10
The Fifth Element,what nice little introduction myth fifth element will unite more common four wipe out evil we learn those who keep secret its location we dont quite know if these aliens good not until later but we do find out impetus their coming temple display cut forward time introduces us president galaxies played what would seem horrible casting but ends up being pretty good tommy tiny lister jr our head priest guarding truth ian holm holm explains what dark force coming after them goes quest find fifth element her four stones needed combat supreme being played wonderfully milla jovovich childlike glee discovery falls into unwitting hands cabbie korben dallasbruce willis his sarcastic badass best willis must join holm jovovich mission recover stones find way save world,9
The Fifth Element,lot success lies man behind all luc besson his script made up pretty solid plot line far world destruction goes everything makes sense explained way not bore us but instead tidbits culled numerous characters running about singularly unique landscape art direction spectacular being decade old still has some nice special effects stand up ive always been proponent prosthetics when able expense computer graphics reactions always better actors who have something real play off lighting environments just become more realistic even so when computers used effects more subtle than flashy never take away story being told no matter what spectacle display script what important,8
The Fifth Element,all personalities display also lead much greatness fifth element has offer bruce willis king kind role his quips rapport those around him priceless other standouts chris tucker early role him great gary oldman tucker takes loud obnoxious whole new level but works flawlessly his radio dj has no shame when comes working crowd chasing ladies but his utter fear danger hilarious oldman i have believe besson just said create something fresh villain pastiche so many crazy components his futuristic hair complete plastic half shield plain weird southern accent buck teeth look just right amount hillbilly disposition greed ambivalence perfect bad guy when he explains how destruction allows all little machines man created finally have work cleaning up mess its fantastic real beauty though no matter how many strong lead roles here little guys steal scenes well singer tricky great oldmans right arm mathieu kassovitz partakes one best scenes film when he attempts mug willis his apartment,8
The Fifth Element,even all its camp fun besson keeps all grounded drama any fantasy tale does he has real vision aesthetics has changed his scope often he goes film film mobstercorrupt cop world new york countryside war joan arc he never pigeonholes himself style i am still holding out hope his newest angela all its black white stylish noir feel will hit big screens here buffalo will real shame if rumors true completion his children tale arthur minimoys will final work him director,10

Fatal Affair,okay lets start good shall we,2
Fatal Affair,i gave movie 2 stars 1 star scenery house beach gorgeous other star because movie only 129 thank lord,3
Fatal Affair,nowthe bad theres lot bad but ill make quick,5

Fatal Affair,crazy david crazy invincible because hes so darn hard kill he gets stabbed but still able chase ellie her husband but heres most laughable part movie after david tries kill her husband she hold him trying save him falling off cliff,2

Fatal Affair,just awful writer deserves dckof year award writing pos enjoyable getting teeth pulled not what i signed up please stop making crap like anymore actually put some thought into what you producing again do not waste your time horrible movie shame producers such garbage,2
Fatal Affair,course its better work actor than unemployed but movie really badit sucks theres lot great very good movies genre out there well they could do comedy movieevery scenes have potential do hilarous comedy,3
Fatal Affair,film hit netflix today i have now watched fatal affair here my review premise film sees woman attempt rekindle her marriage when she has encounter old friend but he cant leave her alone main character nia long straight 90s lead here she fine she does decent job here just there nothing remarkable about her character all she fine role but all movie she really bland generic here supporting characters omar epps plays stalker here again he fine he doesnt stand out amazing character but he plays creep fine does come across way some times also rest cast just fine but again nobody stands out all story story so bland unreal i cant believe films like made these days fatal attraction came out so long ago film just cheap imitation does nothing i mean nothing feels unique interesting script script here truly awful does nothing help actors they do okay jobs spite script not because there no big dramatic moments no sense humour any point fails miserably here style style has some good moments tension i must admit times when longs character meant creeped out i too so worked there but film paced so slowly even though under 90 minutes felt like 2 hours me really hurt film overall overall i think must have been one quickest reviews i have ever done boring generic movie i would avoid missing literally do anything else 90 minutes your life,1
Fatal Affair,pretty obvious movie another stalker movie but all aside fun watch nia long omar epps working together again nothing unique about plot but so corny lmao i enjoyed id watch over tyler perry movie any day,4
Fatal Affair,even type movieis really bad2 hours my life wasted,1
Fatal Affair,predictible boring some tense moments but overall its lame movie i love nia long she made movie worth watching end otherwise waste time,3
Fatal Affair,shame netflix delivering such clichéd film storyline has been done so many times honest i dont know why i even bothered watch i guess i hoping theyd bring something new thisalas they did not we need originality not done death storylines every lifetime movie has story give miss,3
Fatal Affair,no one does stalker fatal like glenn close no one but weve had many follow stepfather boy next door perfect guy etc just another generic movie follows very wooden acting usual friend wont listen violent past stalker etc theres just no reason make film but passes time its 45 me,8
The Gentlemen,writing directing acting general production all top notch i have not had much fun watching movie long time will go down cult classic so do not miss,9
The Gentlemen,has there ever been bad performance guy ritchie movie if there has i havent noticed he has ornate ability take average actors make them great take already great actors get even more out them there few directors around who specialise but ritchie right near top cast gentlemen admittedly fantastic but doesnt change fact they absolute treat watch matthew mcconaughey his element role he born play charlie hunnam plays one coolest characters ive seen perfectly colin farrell hilarious ridiculously cool well then hugh grant gives one best performances ive ever seen him fact grant so good i didnt even recognise his voice had wonder if theyd dubbed they hadnt hed just nailed,9
The Gentlemen,style movie possesses just so much fun watch if youve seen any ritchies previous similar films lock stock two smoking barrels snatch rocknrolla then you know what im talking about pacing moves lightning speed dialogue quick clever deeper than you first realise conflict always multilayered one actually told quite unique way couple characters going over events have already happened works masterfully breaks story up gives room creativity storytelling process also humour,8
The Gentlemen,every time i see ritchie has made movie isnt crimethriller i get little disappointed its not other stuff hes doing bad swept away being obvious exception its just he so damn good style movie hes best business if he only did these rest his career id very happy man excellent movie well worth your time money,8
The Gentlemen,fun film i greatly impressed hugh grants performance had do double take when he first appeared screen colin farrell scene stealer michelle dockery makes great mob wife,9
The Gentlemen,its guy ritchies best since snatch its where he most playful comfortable film genre he knows well cast perfectly picked especially hugh grant giving different but yet so funny performance sit back enjoy 2 hours british crime drama which doesnt take itself too serious if we hadnt had lock stock snatch then would possibly looked more classic ritchie film so dont expect great those,10
The Gentlemen,whipsmart 123 dialogue filmediting tension some seriously laughoutloud moments killer unorthodox script equals gentlemen,10
The Gentlemen,there lot similarities knives out within but would disservice say its only knives out guy ritchie version because film deserves stand its own merits,9
The Gentlemen,its violent goes out its way antipc possible its most definitely not children under age 15but most all its highly enjoyable all performances excellent i cant fault movie any way maybe isnt bestest movie evar but i can safely say will one best 2020,7
The Gentlemen,charlie hunnam legitimately scary mcconaughey nails his role colin farrell has great comedic role all accents spot please give me more,9
The Gentlemen,after seeing film advanced screening i left pleasently surprised one best crime films i have watched best guy ritchieeven better than snatch lock stock which something,8
The Gentlemen,acting story cinematography pacing dialogue humour overall enjoyment i cannot fault it1010 special credit goes colin farrell his acting,10
The Gentlemen,we dont really get movies like anymore movies these days cheap money grabbers superhero films whole different class film,8
The Gentlemen,every now again i go cinema watch film grabs my attention straight away keeps right end one those films what entertainment better than anything else i have seen considerable time,9
The Gentlemen,first i thought started little slowly but hindsight just right perfect execution classic british gangster film epitomised charismatic colin farrell who stole every scene he entered left me crying out coach spin off all all very enjoyable classic guy ritchie film,10
The Gentlemen,guy ritchie returned his early style multiple clues multiple characters excellent rhythm control various black humor satire addictive violence,8
The Gentlemen,rather unconventional visionary guy ritchie has been stuck hollywood rut last ten years ever since he committed big budget visual effects heavy films such sherlock holmes king arthur legend sword years underwhelming live action version classic disney aladdin british director goes back his roots highly entertaining gangster film gentlemen surprisingly nails every bold punch he makes,8
The Gentlemen,although his aladdin made ton money critically film disaster his return underground world bribery drugs moneylaundering bloodcoveredclass refreshing entertaining films script deals two storylines same time almost breaking fourth wall tongueincheek commentary todays hollywood how big movie studios hungry some original yet overly mainstream basic content lure people into cinemas go watch their films,9
The Gentlemen,beginning quick flash forward ends bang pair brains splattered all over pint pickled egg typical british pub we dial back quiet evening raymonds charlie hunnam cosy house when private investigator intrusive sly fox fletcher hugh grant turns up his house he explains he has been keeping eye different gangs around town quite while narrating most film making some stuff up make things more spectacular himself he reads his mostly finished movie script raymond bribing him into funding his little project else hell leak all information he has raymonds boss mickey pearson matthew mcconaughey white trash american expat who has build himself marijuana empire,9
The Gentlemen,mickey tired business trying sell his highly profitable company dynasty oklahoma billionaires but when one underground weedplantations gets raided group british lads filming entire thing posting youtube some sort fightmusicvideo quickly becomes clear some mobster bosses havent been exactly honest about their meetings loyalty towards each other when real war begins while keeping classy,9
The Gentlemen,ritchie cowrote story ivan atkinson marn davies who havent written anything before idea entire film prodigious but screenplay dialogue simply unprecedented ritchie himself bringing joke after joke while taking you thrilling ride full genius twists new ways incorporate classic gangster cinema ritchiestyle composer christopher benstead debuting his very first score feature film gentlemen knows exactly how set tone drive up eleven promising talent wont go unnoticed,10
The Gentlemen,ritchie introduces new characters throughout film keeping audience edge their seat surprising them actual cinema getting best angles money shots thanks his cinematographer alan stewart aladdin when adding layer after layer story going deeper into underground scene adding new protagonist whos into human trafficking mickeys queen wife cockney cleopatra rosalind michelle dockery who owns sanctuary ladies some sort business coverup her husbands weedempire becomes clear every role has purpose there no extras involved story one best acting ensembles recent cinema history welcome reminder mcconnaughey why he won oscar first place but its colin farrell highly entertaining coach hugh grant who steal every scene theyre their remarkable wit thatll sure land them some baftanominations,10
The Gentlemen,gentlemen ruthless firstclass kick teeth do not let failures ritchies recent career choices scare you actually one best films hes ever made who knew guy ritchie could raise bar not just himself but everyone out there trying brush him off has been 2020 off great start,3
The Gentlemen,story attractivegood acts good cast could mini series,10
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,i love tarantino i super excited see movie started then went i waited plot then came went within last 15 minutes film then i left confused little disappointed,7
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,movie just felt like tarantino wanted show off how much he knows about film history how nostalgic old hollywood made him feel acting amazing cinematography amazing storyline just wasnt there though i want say i loved so bad but just felt so flat me,10
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,characters didnt really develop all leos character just kind changed halfway through only narration why he different brad pitts character exact same entire film margot robbies characters development she finally said like 20 words very end,10
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,ending most enjoyable part without doubt felt like classic tarantino scene rest though just felt like normal movie dialogue didnt feel like him me most part exception few scenes soundtrack phenomenal caught vibe movie flawlessly,2
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,maybe i just hoping more maybe i missed out something enjoyable movie but just felt off me i really hope he will make final movie end his career bang because not one,3
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,first 2 hours only lovers everything late 60s retrogreat cinematography outstanding actingthe last 45 minutes fasten your seatbelts because classic tarantino kicks,1
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,heres why not everyone will like movie its not like all tarantinos other movies its not like any modern movies either once upon time hollywood melancholy slow burning comedic love letter age hollywood we find ourselves disconnect nowadays,6
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,point movie isnt just like pulp fiction tell stories have no meaning fact i would argue tarantino wants each every story have meaning rick dalton leonardo dicaprio faded action star struggling hold onto his career fame every scene he enjoyable he internally argues himself better than he he cant find work except typecast villain turns down offer go overseas initially because he thinks its too far step down his past career daltons story not fun me his stunt double cliff booths brad pitt but i will get minute daltons story some will say boring overdrawn pointless i say most important interesting storyline movie rick alcoholic deals lot anger towards himself particularly his trailer youll see what i mean long scenes showing him act out his part villain western extremely entertaining dicaprio does some brilliant work letting us see dalton actor without losing touch him slipping into acting his own he finally decides go overseas but most time spent montage when he returns he dons new italian wife entirely new fashion straight europe he doesnt do much towards end except burn manson follower alive his pool then he finally becomes friends his neighbors ill also get when i talk about sharon tate rick representative hollywood time 1969 unless you familiar film history will lost you 1969 movies like easy rider bonnie clyde graduate were changing face cinema eroding censorship codes finally getting studios hand reigns directors thus entering age auterism actors like rick were becoming absolete film number reasons but mainly they hadnt had search work whilst under studio system they just signed contract found work immediately roman polanski his neighbor one directors now given lot free reign age daltons character expressed frustration many probably felt time tarantino built character beautifully acted dicaprio,9
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,cliff booth other hand most tarantino character movie i think hell fan favorite because he requires no historical context empathy understand hes stunt double who lives much worse than his star dalton nono sense badass muddled past his scenes were incredibly fun pitt brought certain energy each scene glued you screen waiting his next move particularly end when tex had him gunpoint he tripping acid obviously he had situation under control but we audience have no idea until he sicks dog them booth character you expect see tarantino movie none his storyline used what people will say pointless mainly because he most involved manson clan,8
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,interestingly manson clan hardly shown movie charles himself only shows up twice only says few words i actually like choice because left lingering thought perhaps manson danger all times didnt play audience way we thought would wasnt story about manson murders manson just happened going time dalton booth were having their struggles intersected,1
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,which brings me my last point sharon tate margot robbie her role while tad less utilized than i expected central because real life tate murdered manson clan if you go audience member knowledge you go whole movie waiting something happen her never does tate herself happy blooming actress who spent time friends danced lot carefree manner underlying want famous she tells people who she clearly disappointed when they dont recognize her tate plays role story showing era actors now replacing rick dalton also showing special hollywood silver screens allure essentially long love letter hollywood tarantino pens what drew him screen through tate,1
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,all its references obscure your face there delicious amount absorb especially cinefiles tarantino has viewer sit back eat up screen imagine we right there characters wonderfully painted portrait hollywood long gone movie will misunderstood because expectations manson murders because audiences nowadays expect action every corner which tarantinos name can attached some capacity without any crazy special effects speak simply fantastic script acting i think many audience members will get bored not understand why its entertaining others i personally think its one tarantinos best if not his absolute best will stand test time movie lovers everywhere agree disagree we all have admit brad pitts dog awesome,10
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,i love qt films couldnt see movie fast enough all i can say what all about so boring did anyone edit film leonardos character not likable only person tolerable brad pitt nothing happened what so ever dialogue not clever movie never went anywhere all just endless scenes other movies being made people driving cars bare feet over kill time ending happened i didnt care anymore i wanted love movie but i havent been bored long long time i wish i felt differently,1
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,reminds me old fable people go see brad pitt leonardo dicaprio film tarantino assume has great despite what they actually seeing screen film incredibly slow paced neither funny nor suspenseful throwing 5 minute fantasy violent scene end after over two hours boredom did not make me change my mind sadly disappointing fan most tarantino films,1
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,if script if could said script had not been tarantino would have never reached theaters perhaps not even cable television movies,5
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,long boring pointless,7
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,cinematography great acting great music reused already written works plot none just almost 3 hours worth some random scenes stiched together without leading anywhere watched twice has not changed my opinion time ended i did not care anymore i just wanted pee after sitting there almost 3 hours what point movie still wondering one tarantinos worst if not worst,10
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,much characters were interesting references actual events were intriguing i suspect film skews older demographic has inkling about hollywood time how society language fashion sense,9
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,margots legs definitely hot she needs show more skin more often,10
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,dog star needs win prize,3
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,short had all elements i seek movie,1
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,had action had violence had atmosphere actually mocked hollywood had playboy bunnies margots legs were spectacularly exciting thin microskirt oh my did i mention i love violence heck i love dogs,8
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,great movie,8
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,people weirdly bitter about saga its great adaptation book whole series movies does good job some these reviews people whove not even seen other films let alone read books these movies book fans they cast perfectly acting exactly what should overdramatized slightly disjointed but perfectly tune awkward bella hot tempered jacob out his element edward even poorly animated baby still goes book its not meant look like real baby people just taking these movies way seriously what they young adult fantasy movies made fans book series,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,why did not have romantic first end more beautiful why did not end if so i gave 9 points apart pleasant film exciting show clearly best film entering new characters also nice,7

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,i am planning buy dvd so i can watch movie again again,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,i really psyched final film twilight saga first breaking dawn did fine job setting up finale though having read books i little curious how some elements would play screen warning spoilers here out page final confrontation volturi only exciting psychological level its essentially just bunch random vampires standing around snow however film does action fans solid capturing content what alice shows aro will happen if he does not alter his plans itself makes compelling tight sequence will leave fans books screaming no didnt happen haha turns out theyre right but its some cool special effects porn nonetheless lot heads get twisted off vamps dire wolves oops wrong franchise– werewolves display their unique fighting abilities excess very elements get drawn into fray its fx mavens dream,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,however theres lot movie between moment newborn vampire bella opens her nowred eyes bigbudget entirely manufactured confrontation its bit mixed bag where film shines its depiction bellas adjustment her new way life kristen stewart has never appeared more comfortable bellas skin she does now i am not sure if difference between human bella vampire bella so much stewart last having fun stuff do screen which admittedly theres been little past films first film bella didnt do much besides bite her lip lot nearly get passively killed couple times new moon she rode some motorcycles tried passively kill herself couple times eclipse she got punch jacob taylor lautner but spent most movie being protected first breaking dawn she got married had baby sorta died but none looked particularly fun play way portraying bella vampire looks fun stewart looks actually enjoying herself no matter what bella doing time around lipbiting thing seems over replaced real smile bella becoming fantastical creature has never seemed more realistic,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,however film not without its flaws passageoftime voiceover bella delivers feels painfully contrived absence ashley greenes alice most proceedings though storyline dictated leaves big hole cullen family dynamic i could say same jackson rathbone jasper but he has been criminally underused screen throughout series anyway team jasper all volturi exception dakota fannings jane few cullens vampire allies overacted though lampshaded somewhat when jacob notes bella transylvanian vampires creepy has big laugh about but all movie gets more right than flubs bellas delight her newfound abilities joy watch she takes down mountain lions beats emmett kellan lutz armwrestling flings werewolves around like stuffed toys there difficulties how she adjusts her condition– her craving human blood seen when she edward robert pattinson accidentally encounter mountain climber frightens her no less challenging how she copes keeping her father charlie her new life while being unable tell him whole story usual billy burkes charlie gets some funny lines very natural rage she feels when she learns jacob has imprinted her baby daughter bellas motherhood feels believable despite her young age her daughters rapid growth mackenzie foy charming ethereal renesmee whose very existence through misunderstanding elicits wrath volturi who has special ability her own course since its core twilight saga bellas edwards love story theres some tastefully presented sex handled less awkwardly than first breaking dawn,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,overall film satisfying ending franchise which finally came into its own installment its been long trip but series saved best last those suffering withdrawal movies based upon works stephenie meyer spring we have film version host look forward completely different universe characters but first trailer looks good so cheer up fans seriouslyfluffy final grade,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,even though i loved movies there were some really awkward moments first one im glad cleared up i only rated 9 stars bc its my least favorite them all i hate edward leaves ive watched all twilight movies least 15 times piece when comes one i basically fastforward through entire middlejacob parts end when edward comes back jacob actor doesnt show same chemistry edward does bella made me despise middle 60 minutes lol,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,i originally expected movie have some basics book except have fight instead then talking out but i pleasantly surprised when showed combination two i also liked how used some music first one brought back lot good memories watching series reading i liked how when bella showed her thoughts edward flashed back through out movies how she fell love him honestly brought tears my eyes reminded me why i fell love twilight first place during fight i pumped ready volturi get their ass kicked made me angry when they killed some cullens but cool thing alice when all turned out vision i still think its sick perverted jacob like love renesmee even if its wolf thing still creepy i do liked how credits not only showed breaking dawn cast buy whole series cast directing great whole movie beautiful me i would definitely go see again i cant wait get dvd i still dont like kristen stewart person actress but overall cast acting pretty good,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,im not twilight fan but i loved ending movie out all series one best,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,bella new improved vampire after childbirth killed her mortality although her union edward fully accepted amongst vampire community their new baby renesmee composite name renee bellas mother esme edwards mother wasnt so lucky after false accusation new family grave trouble powerful volturi who only happen largest vampire regime even still cullens prepared use their special gifts against anyone who threatens their family,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,there certain details film one has accept order appreciate first aside vampires requisite drink blood twilight saga movies focuses majestic viewpoint vampires rather than their dark side when assessing situation way might make easier digest teenage bella literally dying vampire order edward unbeknownst her parents only has loose her soul do furthermore even bella edward being married theres no way around fact twilight glorifies teenage pregnancy,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,if these details can accepted moved past sake fiction film awesome ive seen previous films twilight saga i thought they were captivating times but ive never been impressed much starters continues evolve intense romeo juliet type romance twist however writing twilight breaking dawn part 2 seems best yet i found myself laughing out loud storyline more witty interesting cleverly done action scenes completely unexpected,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,even actors gave better performances highlight performances me were beautiful kristen stewart who plays bella swan not only did she give believable performance incredibly strong vampire such tiny frame but she made funny fascinating watch also giving always reputable performance michael sheen who plays aro one three leaders volturi theres something about his malicious depiction so grimy yet youll love loath him robert pattinson who plays edward funnier than i ever remember him being taylor lautner whose character jacob gives another vigorous performance other wicked actor amplifies inhumanity dakota fanning,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,i saw movie surrounded packed theater energetic twilight fans almost equally entertaining watch film amongst energy crowd team edward vs team jacob especially all boisterous fans who were anti volturi course second jacob took off his shirt girls audience went bananas aro his crew got equal amount rowdy boos,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,regarding topic appropriateness young impressionable teens film warrants least conversation your youngsters issues like intense sexual content violent murder teen defiance,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,overall if youve never seen any twilight saga films one see if youre fan already you will blown away how final movie goes out blast go see twilight breaking dawn part 2 its worthy surprisingly one my favorite films year,9
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,thats right i gave thing 10 because i fully enjoyed call me someone who enjoys movies someone who enjoys leaving reality bit someone whos well being doesnt depend every thing coming together perfectly movie i critique every stupid piece dialog scene only conclusion i can come its so fashionable hate movie people not only feel need write review after review stroking each others egos about how couth they not liking movie all but seem aspire disliking if mere thought they might like would get them banned mensa congratulations youre all so cultured makes rest us want puke final scene fantastic what can i say i heard one reviewer claim fact spoiler ahead vision disappointment what i so relieved carlisle not dead also another reviewer says something about actors being emotionless hey thats there characters theyre vampires thats bit any way if you take yourself too seriously if you have bug firmly lodged up your backside youre not secure enough your masculinity first place then you probably won enjoy any theses movies better stick trying find more ways looks manly like growing goatee shaving your head buying pickup truck,10
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,im guy i watched movie finally while i randomly scrolling through channels tv i had read books long time back didnt think i could watch movie would mean going through heartbreak seeing series end but boy these guys have presented so beautifully 1010 me fan books,10

V for Vendetta,i watch film every 5th november without fail,10
V for Vendetta,i fan v vendetta graphic novel alan moore disinheriting film bit discouraging but hes always been little crazy film version everything i could have possibly hoped gripping chilling intense exciting heartbreaking gets moores music if not his exact words elements slightly different subplots removed but idea v himself would so proud say remains same,10
V for Vendetta,plot surprisingly complex nuanced i dont want give anything more away than previews already have suffice say masked anarchist voiced hugo weaving must save young woman natalie portman during his attempt expose corruption government weaving perfectly cast using his formidable physicality imposing voice give gravitas insanity character portman has gone child teen star finally emerging talented adult actress following her oscarnominated turn closer here she gives her best performance date orphan evey john hurt characteristically impressive enigmatic government leader stephen rea gives wonderful supporting turn police inspector charged finding v before its too late,10
V for Vendetta,wachowski brothers former protégé james mctiegue takes directing duties here helms enormously impressive first feature using every trick book manner reminiscent his mentors breakout hit matrix unlike matrix mctiegue allows story more focus than action result film tense emotional thriller outbursts spectacularly filmed choreographed action showing more maturity restraint than wachowskis mctiegue doesnt show off his trickery isnt self conscious when slowmotion overtakes late action sequence seems natural breathing late cinematographer adrian biddle film dedicated his memory does outstanding job oscarnominated dario marianellis score fantastic accompaniment piece visual effects astonishing terrifying deeply moving especially climatic moments trafalgar square,8
V for Vendetta,solid acting great action fantastic technical wizardry sounds just like another matrixstyle ripoff but biggest difference v story real ideas not fantastic science fiction creation but genuine examination human condition power fear takes center stage here fear war disease famine fear basic human nature has been exploited weapon method control centuries those who would use masked man waits shadows carry out your sentence verdict vengeance v vendetta mustsee,10
V for Vendetta,10oct,10
V for Vendetta,movie masterpiece ahead its time aged amazing becomes more relevant each passing day world 2020 these riots happening george floyd,10
V for Vendetta,i am speechless i just came back theatre where i watched v vendetta there three main elements movie excels all three them,9
V for Vendetta,first off dialogues script intense witty honest but not patronising intelligent but not pretentious thats first level which movie surprises you you dont except such high level script action movie but slowly revealed audience v vendetta not just action movie story filled current events has definite strong political sense,10
V for Vendetta,secondly hugo weavings performance definitely what grabs you start he delivers some hardest lines incredible charisma his performance shines throughout movie honestly he sounds good any best actors out there he should nominated academy award,10
V for Vendetta,finally visual part incredible yet no matrix effects used everything looks beautiful dark yet vibrant cinematography top notch final battle scene brought tears my eyes,9
V for Vendetta,do not miss v vendetta its one best movies all time eternal classic,10
V for Vendetta,10oct,9
V for Vendetta,eve suppression freedoms following 911 government spying intrusions just film we needed over ten years later still exciting riveting whether seen entertainment polemic against rightwingers v hero,10
V for Vendetta,placed futuristic britain movie tells story about dictatorship man who became symbol its downfall people many not say majority countries todays world can easily identify characters great adaptation dc comic always gladly seen natalie portman,10
V for Vendetta,10aug,9
V for Vendetta,its been quite few years since i first saw v vendetta i didnt see release because i far under age demographic time but i managed catch up film around 20112012 not sure exact year but i teenager time i loved matrix still do heard v vendetta written wachowskis so i thought id give shot,8
V for Vendetta,blew me away many ways i credit film being part reason i became less homophobic bigoted many ways first time i saw homosexuality direct positive light media helped me immensely establishing my more leftleaning views christian world i raised,9
V for Vendetta,its reason i have very deep personal relationship film but i love film more enjoyable level well film oozes style everything cinematography sound design ways characters speak act rather sparse use fight scenes comparison other action films its ilk opting rather use political thriller tropes character development surprised me first time i watched but even though film wasnt action packed films like matrix equilibrium both which have massive third act spectacles action i feel much more effective emotional than either those films ironic since equilibrium about emotion while short final fight scene between v creedys men incredible burst ecstatic visceral action makes entire film worth,10
V for Vendetta,you can say there three main characters film theres v titular anarchist vigilante evey young woman who kidnapped slowly falls v more violent twist beauty beast theres detective finch government employee tasked finding unmasking v during task discovering his beloved government isnt noble may seem each these characters given fair due amount screen time they each have full satisfactory character arc i find how well written edited film incredibly impressive writing i want watch film all over again just appreciate more,9
V for Vendetta,there something said however about differences between film original graphic novel written alan moore i havent read original comic but judging alan moores distaste films inspired his work fact he refused watch film after reading script maybe film isnt fans original work theres great comparison video cinefix youtube comparing film novel they very very different each other one notable difference portrayal v vs dictator sutler much more nuanced less black white novel than film very well deserved critique film,8
V for Vendetta,i do not claim v vendetta best film ever made i havent even scraped surface world cinema cinema history ever make claim however i can definitely say v vendetta least time being most personally meaningful movie most enjoyable movie i have ever seen mad max fury road did get close though,9
V for Vendetta,some action might bit choppy but v vendetta extremely entertaining its great visual effects hugo weavings iconic portrayal v more than enough satisfy even strictest viewers there also great message about rising up against political propaganda within its great style environment another great film wachowskis now your hands,10
Toy Story 4,far conclusions beloved franchises go toy story 3 hard beat film tugs heartstrings we learn andys toys no longer his cuts deep realisation growing up means letting go,9
Toy Story 4,naturally i had lot trepidation heading into toy story 4 wasnt so much about whether film would good not pixar have been pretty reliable regard rather about whether despite best efforts everyone involved toy story 4 would able shake off feeling unnecessary well im happy report not only toy story 4 triumph but films heartfelt finale feels like proper sendoff woody his friends proves story needed told,2
Toy Story 4,best way summarise toy story 3 end andys story while toy story 4 likely end toys story,10
Toy Story 4,while essentially roadtrip film story focuses toys finding their place outside world first time its hard not draw analogy between young adults moving out home film captures feeling uncertainty but also new found possibility leaving place comfort entails its joy see series mature along kids who first watched toy story back 1995,1
Toy Story 4,also undoubtedly funniest toy story film largely due bevy hilarious new supporting characters forky definite highlight while keanu reeves steals his scenes duke caboom key peele bring their expert comedic timing pair carnivalprize plush toys who attached together their hands but bounce off each other like rubber balls,1
Toy Story 4,thanks consistently funny script film blast watch when its not making your eyes well up but either way film will likely leave you crying if youre still skeptical about film let me just say nine years may have passed between sequels but series heart beating strong ever,1
Toy Story 4,picture amazing really one most beautiful animations ive seen yet story however boring disappointing when comparing previous films,6
Toy Story 4,previous toy story buzz says important thing we stick together toy story 4 buzz loses all his previous personality he listens his conscious seriously funny very concrete thinking buzz often can times but lets not forget who buzz previous films he began believing he truly space ranger when he finally comes out he realizes hes not ranger but toy when he finally figures out his importance value his family toys he becomes loyal committed andy rest group woody together they get rid sid fly van conquer all sorts missions next movies buzz takes lead toy story 2 help track down save woody but toy story 4 its like hes drone all he can do listen his little toy commands hes straight up clueless film one point he actually abandons woody antique shop when odds were highly against them because his push button told him really thats not buzz we know love buzz we knew almost died woody furnace he would go ends earth his buddies they were team family but not anymore now buzz drone little thoughts himself anymore he does whatever his buttons tell him goodbye woody sorry if you die antique shop but my conscious told me quit thats all took really ok,1
Toy Story 4,woody fearless leader all three movies until one yes he still had heart gold but he went bo peeps hero sharif she looked up his whipping boy she straight up tells him one point hes essentially stupid doesnt know what hes doing needs get line follow her really woody went her hero her little boy he literally follows her around apologizing his tail tucked between his legs goodbye woody nice knowing you now youre wimpy cowboy doll who lets all girls beat crap out you basically tell you youre worthless you arent played anymore you stick closet while cowgirl new sheriff town another doll unapologetically rips your pull string out because she feels only way get her own worth so you just turn over take abuse love your life says your basically washed up need follow her lead because how stupid you not how i imagined woody going out franchise,1
Toy Story 4,if only gabby doll would have showed ounce remorse what she did woody would have driven home sacrifice he made her allow her take his pill string start new life her own no villain takes what she wants never shows bit gratitude woody,10
Toy Story 4,these new carnival characters feel like they were pulled out new pets movie they had some great comic relief points but felt like they were wrong movie they felt really out place,5
Toy Story 4,kaboom guy another completely random useless character felt like he another insert try make people laugh though his only purpose film,1
Toy Story 4,we never get see bulls eye rex rest gang they literally were extras film unlike other three movies,10
Toy Story 4,forky creative spin things added some great comedy but really emotional connection characters we poorly done film i literally bored just waiting next thing happen i didnt care about end clips when credits rolled story so weak,1
Toy Story 4,poor way say goodbye our beloved characters we didnt even really get say goodbye most them they were hiding rv whole time,4
Toy Story 4,i thought would tear jerker but i dont really care woody not part gang anymore they took away all elements bonded these characters together first place,3
Toy Story 4,franchise should have ended 3,7
Toy Story 4,ive been watching rewatching all toy story films years now have loved them all never wanted them end because i could never see end such beloved series films but everything eventually has finish out toy story 4 does beautifully im guy who usually doesnt cry movie theatres heck its rare sight see me crying but i bawling end they did leave make other films which i hope they do but if they left like i wouldnt sad because closed all emotional doors needed closed me personally even opened some i had never knew could open before highly recommend 1010,1
Toy Story 4,welli prefer considering toy story 4 side story someone who doesnt know anything about characters made just fun big fan toy story years i very disappointed whole plot first our beloved characters like jessie bullseye rex ham mr mrs potato head slinky dog little aliens almost got no screen time buzz barely got some time even then made him look dumb if he wasnt so serious about finding woody all these happened shake new toyswho were interesting sometimes funny but wasnt necessary see them all time something else i want mention if you know original characters you know its impossible them just sit van do nothing help their friend who needs them i dont think finding bo beep again giving her all screentime positive thing she nothing special beginning also bonnie suddenly loving fork more than toys she promised take care shows than she never really deserved have them yes fine toy story 3 whole gang ended up new home someone would play them again even though big change because i had hope may end like happily starting new life nice new kid will take care thembut notoy story 4 came give us depressing plot twist my opinion terrible end woody separating gang whatever reason so heartbreaking fan who heard news about toy story 4 excited watch especially reason doesnt represent woodys personality values conclusion movie good kids anyone who havent heard about original toy story,1
Toy Story 4,toy story has become integral part our lives reels us all back into childhood keeps our innocence alive toy story has had privilege taking us all journey sadly toy story 4 has brought our childlike innocence screeching halt,1
Toy Story 4,although really goes without saying toys should have never been given away bonnie keep nostalgia alive toy story 3 andy could have kept his toys attic ending could have shown glimpses andy getting married having children ending part 3 could have very easily been bittersweet see andys toys given his own children woody buzzs legacy faithfulness andys children continue,1
Toy Story 4,toy story 4 felt like slap face not only all fans toy story but hope film brought main charachter really focuses solely woody which becomes apparent end film no way taking away laughs film brought because quite amusing plot felt scattered pointless adult whom had favorite toys saved attic my childrentoy story 4 huge disappointment gabby gabbys character felt quite selfish leaving woody condition they left him didnt feel selfless felt robbed his loyalty although stuffed bunny chick were funny their characters felt like pixar looking ways find laughs finding bo peep conclusion story not good enough reason create toy story 4,3
Toy Story 4,sad misstep toy storys legacy having mixed reviews audience toy story 4 after long love inception just saddening,7
Toy Story 4,i love toy story probably one my all time favourites i lucky even enough have original buzz light year toy so obviously when i found out toy story 4 being released i couldnt wait i love all disney but good know i could watch film wasnt remake i could go into film feeling like i did when i watched toy story first time,3
Toy Story 4,i wanted like film so much dont get me wrong animation beautiful first scene brilliant felt like good old days i hopeful rest film but unfortunately film just didnt sit right,1
A Clockwork Orange,completely brilliant film amazing its characterization its pacing its character development its visuals book superb but stanley genius who has midas touch,8
A Clockwork Orange,glory glory violence,9
A Clockwork Orange,some ultraviolence too,9
A Clockwork Orange,worlds most stylish interesting amazing movie,10
A Clockwork Orange,few films sensational infamous stanley kubricks clockwork orange its impossible sit through aco not have reaction whether shock disgust amazement savage tale brutal young droog his subsequent reformation government shocking thoughtprovoking ever,10
A Clockwork Orange,while films depictions violence sex what its most known aco works far deeper levels disturbing portrayal youth its satirical depiction governments attempts create better society brilliant but most fascinating aspect aco questions poses about good evil while crimes alex commits beginning film atrocious what government does him worse film presents absolute worst aspects man but shows even these still favorable man without choice people can denounce film because its brutal content but importance questions poses cant denied,9
A Clockwork Orange,equally excellent films content effort crew kubricks perfectionism pays off well aco one his most visually striking films malcolm macdowell nothing short amazing alex kubricks use surreal imagery set pieces well ingenious use music compliment onscreen action creates world perfectly reflects protagonists behavior governments policies,9
A Clockwork Orange,clockwork orange no means easy film get through many will turned off scenes violence rape but masterpiece far more complex than simple romp through world youthful violence its rare example filmmaking demands viewer actually think real horrorshow all around oh my brothers,10
A Clockwork Orange,its hard judge film such its cold hard yet can exhilarating sarcastic can average yet can visionary exploitive satirical too many questions consider when one watches film,10
A Clockwork Orange,even after 34 years film still speaks volumes about our current culture which many ideals ringing true today younger generations out control due lack parental control junk culture becoming commonplace violence desensitizing masses we all seem enjoying ride way down its very difficult find movies which can make such startling commentary yet hold such accusations extended period time nowadays films focusedgrouped death conformity more powerful than artistry money far more important than quality kubrick took huge leap film challenging society take hard look itself unfortunately society wasnt ready film which why revered now more than ever,10
A Clockwork Orange,i would say movie really gem art piece use excellent imagery coupled pretty outoftheplace background score tells us about uniqueness movie stanley kubrick has really applied lot thought into,10
A Clockwork Orange,director wants audience feel something bad not because he showing bad but because really bad background music accompanying ultra violent scenes comical not dramatic anything else commonly associated such scenes gives viewer opportunity feel bitterness not because music hints so but because he himself feels so viewers emotions should arise irrespective what director trying show one greatest successes movie,10
A Clockwork Orange,another glorifying feature central idea movie if human striped choice choose good evil he no longer remains human he becomes clockwork when alex brainwashed programmed choose only good he wasnt accepted society shows irony objectives british government word orange title presumably comes word ourange loosely means man hence title so appropriate movie,10
A Clockwork Orange,artificiality dialogues sets give movie unique feature enhance grip also means viewer has get more involved definitely one best technically shot movies another masterpiece kubrick like space oddessey,10
A Clockwork Orange,uninitiated set near future britain movie shows malcom macdowell head group youngsters involved sexual violence turn events leave protagonist hands police worried growing number prisoners british government devises method programming them so they always choose good alex chosen one those which new system tested rest unfolds saga very human characteristic,8
A Clockwork Orange,lastly i would like say you may compelled leave movie between but if you watching art cinematic experience i recommend you sit through,10
A Clockwork Orange,say alex character stanley kubricks clockwork orange unlikable like saying manson family sort bad hes not just unlikable hes despicable terrifying sick twisted ultimately haunting embodiment all our greatest realistic fears worries but alex does not see himself sick person key his voiceover narrative,10
A Clockwork Orange,alex does not see himself pervert just we do not see our own flaws ramond babbitt did not see his own autism us we all normal which scary thought,8
A Clockwork Orange,clockwork orange which originally released 1973 after appeal r rating granted after originally being tagged xrated motion picture had been banned britain close thirty years most film fans europe will tell you they had seen movie grainy bootleg videotapes years ago when they were young curious,9
A Clockwork Orange,but those us lucky enough enjoy squirm through clockwork orange its entire odd splendor experience you likely never forget its characters its style its subject matter its explicit materialall combines create marvelous whole will stay you long after credits stop rolling,10
A Clockwork Orange,essentially tale focused alexs journeys jail his process being resubmitted world after inhumane treatments cure evil out him clockwork orange indeed offbeat its title,10
A Clockwork Orange,all tales redemption involve characters we gradually come appreciate like orat very leastlearn tolerate not clockwork orange our narrator remains same throughout movie always incarnation everything wrong todays modern world he goes through no cleansing process end film we like him less than we did beginning thats daring,10
A Clockwork Orange,droogies do style,10
Event Horizon,theres something really special about movie but i cant put my finger maybe its combination scifi horror which create very distinct atmosphere you can just feel throughout entire flick maybe its idea helldimension accessible through black hole something so far away yet so closeby gives me creeps even though you dont see anything dontwannabetheredimension effect has crew just says all plot maybe quite simple but film doesnt dwell too much does not imply mindblowing idea you wont hear laurence fishburne saying oh my god hell dimension how even possible nothing movie scarier than stuff ive seen before still scariness event horizon isnt gore nor shock awe moments no its atmosphere its ominousness which somehow grabs you doesnt let go its gutfeeling event horizon gutmovie maybe thats thing i couldnt put my finger,8
Event Horizon,first glance event horizon would appear science fiction film through through its set future features spacecraft men women who fly them about rescue mission another spacecraft yet before long its quickly obvious event horizon fact horror film set space surprisingly effective one while not masterpiece reasonably disturbing film,7
Event Horizon,event horizon opens mid 21st century where man has attempted fasterthanlight travel vessel built space ship event horizon contained its heart artificial singularity miniature black hole if you will will open door another part universe upon first test engine ship disappeared not heard again seven years later reappears orbit over neptune rescue ship lewis clark dispatched determine if there survivors what happened event horizon along ride ships designer dr weir sam neill whos going through strong trauma his life after his wife has recently committed suicide crew lewis clark commanded captain miller laurence fishburne listen weirs explanation what happened event horizon then receive transmission ship garbled but seems suggest not so pleasant fate crew lewis clark crew dock event horizon begin investigating ghost ship but find strange happenings occurring throughout different members crew seeing strange things miller sees man he left dead exploding vessel medical officer peters kathleen quinland sees her crippled son ships engineer justin jack noseworthy looked into singularity engine put into state shock weir begins seeing visions his wife,8
Event Horizon,quickly becomes apparent event horizon has been somewhere other than another part galaxy has brought something back,7
Event Horizon,event horizon not groundbreaking entry horror genre thats sure many aspects display have been utilized countless other films yet director paul anderson manages give us requisite chills leave us edge our seats primary element helps film event horizon itself designed very gothic look mind ship just looks feels scary place i cant imagine anyone ever being comfortable being dark empty hallways rooms menacing themselves helps ratchet up tension anderson also does good job crafting suspenseful scenes involving characters visions almost every one those sequences will leave you unsure what you will see keeps audience state unease,7
Event Horizon,film progresses there increase makeup effects grusomeness so i would agree makes difficult film watch goes however most everything last halfhour payoff setup so while its not always pretty watch makes all more effective,7
Event Horizon,acting wise event horizon decent but nobody will well remembered their work sam neill probably most memorable slowly disintegrating weir tumbling madness before our eyes laurence fishbure effective hardnosed captain everyone else gets job done,9
Event Horizon,lot people gave event horizon flack upon its release again its not most original horror film made but one more disturbing i saw mid late 90s i would give recommendation just careful watching yourself,10
Event Horizon,unfairly dismissed combination alien hellraiser event horizon one those films should ranked among classics its genre yet has somehow fallen wayside revered movie geeks horror aficionados but ultimately ignored mainstream whats especially surprising excellent film came directing skills paul w anderson who also responsible such tragic misfires resident evil alien versus predator shows there more hollywoods generic director hire than first imagined,8
Event Horizon,set year 2047 story concerns sudden reappearance prototype spaceship event horizon title which vanished its maiden voyage seven years previously salvage ship called lewis clark sent out investigate brings along dr william weir sam neil physics expert originally responsible ships creation they dock horizon but find no signs life they set about making repairs crew begin experience hallucinations sense they not alone,6
Event Horizon,so far so very familiar but far far more than rip off disguising itself homage one thing there no predatory alien hunter loose instead horror far more psychological not there isnt fair amount violence gore but gradual sense unease builds up crafted more crews growing sense anxiety paranoia plus there no definitive explanation given what they experiencing just what these ghosts their pasts doing ship what exists other side black hole another dimension where mankind never meant go movie itself suggests but doesnt confirm very depths hell itself couple excellent set design ship modelled notre dame cathedral paris pulsepounding moments latter half when chaos sets you have one tremendously enjoyable horror film best watched alone night all lights off where you can properly get swept up its claustrophobic atmosphere youll never need eyes see again,8
Event Horizon,actually one my favorite horror movies smart scary yes even little disturbing times while some ideas behind science absurd why its called sciencefiction,7
Event Horizon,cast does good job their roles setting movie dark creepy perfectly done,5
Event Horizon,i have read several bad reviews these comments i have seen basically two categories such one science involved ridiculous movie horror movie horror movie spaceship future i think its time suspend your disbelief enjoy movie,8
Event Horizon,second complaint i have been reading even worse movie too scary disturbing i dont think i have ever sat down watch scary movie been upset wasscary perhaps movie accidentally placed childrens section,10
Event Horizon,regardless movie fun scary exactly what most people look scary movie i highly suggest renting gem enjoying what one better horror movies late 90s,10
Event Horizon,film lot better than what most people gave credit cinematography excellent lighting gave film very eerie feel certainly better than average scifi film not only did film mix two mediums almost perfectly scifi horror completed union almost flawlessly not perfect movie but then again sam neill amazing film virtually all technical aspects film were topnotch while didnt advance film industry overall did make impact scifi genre,8
Event Horizon,event horizon pretty good scifihorror movie which youll either love hate its very dark depressing movie which completely justifies terror tagline perhaps continuing terror why some people probably dislike,8
Event Horizon,far i know most horror movies lack decent story decent acting character development thats why im not into horror movies much but event horizon has interesting story ideal most all original environment horror movie even though character development limited film progresses youll get know most characters better especially sam neills dr weir laurence fishburns cpt miller characters,10
Event Horizon,acting done very well most cast most notable laurence fishburn sam neill who did good job sets other hand brilliant creepy same time i would not feel comfortable walking around any those rooms especially engineering room featuring gravity drive sphere 3 magnetic rings within room filled deadly spikes walls ceiling adds more tension than there already movie which makes experience only better worthwhile,8
Event Horizon,special effects movie quite treat ranging external view gigantic event horizon around neptune dr weir his handywork his eyes,1
Event Horizon,my opinion good but underrated scifi horror movie lots freaky moments will keep your heart racing if you like depressing endless terror youll like movie quite bit if you rather have happy endings laughs youll probably dislike,1
Mulholland Drive,10oct,10
Mulholland Drive,recently i read excerpt book dennis lim called david lynch man another place author mentions how much lynch despises interpretation his work he writes,10
Mulholland Drive,writing about david lynch can hard not hear his voice your head protesting violence being done his work soon you put things words no one ever sees film same way he once told me thats what i hate you know talking—its real dangerous not nothing does mulholland drive lynch movie has invited most fervent flurry explication end word caution silencio,8
Mulholland Drive,reminded me 11 years before edit i had written very review imdb which contained interpretation films plot ive decided remove all whether not you satisfied particular interpretation plot should irrelevant your enjoyment film i enjoyed before i had satisfying interpretation im hoping i can clear my mind next time i watch mulholland dr,10
Mulholland Drive,i will leave one thing my original post quote peter greenaway i would argue if you want write narratives author novelist dont film maker because i believe film making so much more exciting areas which arent primarily do narrative,9
Mulholland Drive,theres sign lost highway says,10
Mulholland Drive,major spoilers ahead,10
Mulholland Drive,but you already knew didnt you,1
Mulholland Drive,since theres great deal people apparently did not get point movie id like contribute my interpretation why plot makes perfect sense others have pointed out one single viewing movie not sufficient if you have dvd md you can cheat looking david lynchs top 10 hints unlocking md but only upon second third viewing please,10
Mulholland Drive,first all mulholland drive downright brilliant masterpiece kind movie refuse leave your head not often comments dvds very accurate but vogues gets inside your head stays there really hit mark,1
Mulholland Drive,david lynch deserves praise creating movie not only has beautifully stylish look cinematographywise has great acting esp naomi watts haunting soundtrack badalamenti very dreamlike quality but top all also manages involve viewer such way few movies have before after all when last time you saw movie just wouldnt leave your mind everyone felt compelled talk write about regardless whether they liked hated,10

Yesterday,after being subjected number films documenting lives musicians most notably bohemian rhapsody rocketman rolling thunder revue bob dylan story truly pleasure presented film sheds light work life artist while not adhering strict though desirable biographical approach exactly what makes piece so marvellous i came out cinema greater appreciation beatles their music through fictional story did not feature four men we familiar all quite often film achieved my admiration band without me consciously noticing,7
Yesterday,another level film made satire modern music industry revealed how apparent solo artists far their titles huge teams people pushing them preferred more commercial creative direction taking musicians creative power done humorous light most themes presented film romantic aspect film evident beginning dominant aspect story possibly shifting focus piece little too much however still helps provides satisfying ending,7
Yesterday,film pays great amount respect fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts,6
Yesterday,there were three main reasons really seeing yesterday alternative world scenario sounded truly fascinating one most fascinating concepts recent years me refreshing change remakes sequels constantly made today like love lot danny boyles previous films find him talented director beatles not all time favourites but do appreciate him highly understand their influence music like lot their songs lot,6
Yesterday,while could have done more its concept yesterday turned out still entertaining charming put me my sister uplifting mood leaving cinema had not had easy day week even up seeing film so yesterday much needed appreciated antidote far films released 2019 go neither one best worst hit miss year somewhere around solid middle if having rank,10
Yesterday,yesterday slick looking film not exemplary but never cheap lily james looks great camera clearly loves her music course fantastic beatles after all some their greatest hits exuberantly performed making one want sing along regardless whether they know all words not hey jude one most memorable examples script balances amusing comedy never oversentimental drama without making too cartoonish mawkish well mostly,9
Yesterday,storywise yesterday captures feelgood spirit affectionately portrayal music industry fun didnt get over top john lennon bit highlight boyle has done better more inspired direction but still directs crisp pace balances things quite well performances good truly charming james coming off best himesh patel has come long way since eastenders while kate mckinnon riotous manager role,10
Yesterday,other viewpoint concept so fascinating while always engaging story predictable bit too ordinary especially final third which pretty much exactly one would expect,6
Yesterday,ed sheerans extended cameo my tastes rather puzzling didnt seem gel everything else,5
Yesterday,all aside enjoyable film whole worth seeing 710,9
Yesterday,great idea some ways film made vision work i just dont think they did enough though instead fell back into traditional love story formula music helped carry lot through unsurprisingly what they missed wasnt necessarily songs themselves but era which they came out meaning time movie just presented almost instant stardom if todays world heard songs which lets honest todays generation wouldnt understand half didnt really present clear vision why which i looking towards end help tie things up lights go off planet he takes bump head then beatles never existed alternate universe dream thought there wouldve been something more there there were few things bothered me story movie made seem like they were pieces puzzle but then never did anything them first through film he also finds out other things dont exist well such coke cigarettes band oasis harry potter seemed like these things were going connect into story why beatles music isnt present but they just left there he kind says oh well nothing comes second he finds out there two others also know beatles music again seems like should big part story tie things together bit why but they just have conversation about she gives him address then thats his conversation what i think supposed john lennon didnt make sense either does mean other 4 exist did they never meet make music just all added up great idea worked early film but didnt follow through properly all my opinion course,8
Yesterday,original premise movie fantastic only one man knows beatles ever existed brings their music world,4
Yesterday,could have been really really great unfortunately idea under developed felt if films makers werent quite sure what do,9
Yesterday,ended up being nice sweet when could have been brilliant,6
Yesterday,refreshingly original entertaining story flows characters relatable well developed not what i expected trailer but i liked better than what i expected so nice see someone take chance original story,8
Yesterday,i went into wondering if they were going explain whole premise being dream such he going get caught crucified he going get girl lose girl so many movies fixated realism difficulties negativity yes he faces several difficulties but movie light beautiful fantastic music if i want realism i watch documentary what i go movies really well done,9
Yesterday,there some movies when released simply dont need big marketing campaign just few words description plot enough put your must see list struggling musician has cycling accident during freak global blackout wakes world where noone other than him remembers beatles any their songs when i heard i said myself yes yes yes but would live up my expectations,10
Yesterday,richard curtis penned film thats immediately enough put tranche moviegoers off all his movies have accent uplifting positive andor whimsical i can understand why winds some people up if richardcurtissy adjective i think should many these films can so classified,10
Yesterday,here although again very richardcurtissy i think he gets mixture just right yesterday me complete joy beginning end,5
Yesterday,i imagine curtis getting story rowdy dinner party round his gaff he asks his guests over third bottle dessert wine play wild fantastical what if game pursuit very good spare brownie course particular event i guess costoryauthor jack barth his moviewriting debut made successful attempt hog brownie premise yesterday quite brilliant whilst same time being utterly bonkers too,8
Yesterday,being said story not completely original i thought there were many similarities ricky gervais vehicle 2009 invention lying where gervais alone finds he suddenly has ability tell lies finds illgotten fortune fame result much like earlier film much joy here recognition gift given dawning realisation what might actually mean him such i found first half film lot more enjoyable than second,5
Yesterday,conundrum facing jack remeber all beatles songs their lyrics without having google reference much fun had him stumbling into situations suddenly remind him new track particular snatch lyric,10
Yesterday,there course obvious explanation whacky storyline since hero has received potentially serious head injury but would film go there no spoilers here,10
Yesterday,himesh patel tvs eastenders but here makes his movie debut he perfectly cast jack malik film hes name about rise utter obscurity lowestoft retail assistant global superstardom patel charming believable he squirms his conscience surprising touching beach scene final reel film exquisitely acted,10
Yesterday,everwatchable utterly gorgeous lily james here goes brunette she actually unrecognisable me both trailer poster here she makes very believable highschool teacher sideline management roadieing,10
Pitch Perfect,we two 50 grandmas went see film spur moment because we enjoy musical movies we were probably oldest people audience which ranged down younger teens but everyone regardless age laughing having grand time much less schmaltzy selfserious than glee but wonderful vocals dancing personality you cant help but fall love hilariously quirky characters especially rebel wilson irrepressible fat amy elizabeth banks gail sexually frustrated female announcer hanna mae lee lilly wackadoo who releases most shocking comments voice barely exceeds murmur fun feelgood highly entertaining,9
Pitch Perfect,i loved so much i scored free tickets denver screening awhile back just going have my wife 13 year old daughter go but i watched trailer really thought anna kendrick terrific 5050 very good up air so i thought what heck im going too i glad i did i laughed like crazy loved capella singing film really raunchy just skirts around r rating several times but just so fun,8
Pitch Perfect,i am pretty confident going surprise box office hit fall so much better than films bound compared like mean girls bring even bridesmaids,8
Pitch Perfect,speaking bridesmaids rebel wilson almost steals show every scene she involved being hilarious lesser movie her scenes most certainly would worth paying price admission alone but there so many other talents involved elizabeth banks has never been funnier skylar astin love interest also terrific though he needs change his name because me name skylar brings only one thing mind she married walter white,9
Pitch Perfect,no oscar winner i am certain i will see dozen so better movies year but none will having me laughing smiling much,3
Pitch Perfect,when my girlfriend suggested put i mimed blowing my brains out imaginary revolver,3
Pitch Perfect,mistake great fun film,9
Pitch Perfect,all girl acapella group have regain their crown winning competition so motley crew underdogs assembled including our main character challenge superior competition,7
Pitch Perfect,characters heavily stereotyped source lot comedy i found characters engaging lovable laughed along most gags cynical misogynistic judgemental biased commentators were especially funny,1
Pitch Perfect,singing segments short sharp just enough get your foot tapping without going full blown mary poppins,10
Pitch Perfect,i didnt expect particularly want enjoy but i did lot,8
Pitch Perfect,my recommendation even if not your kind movie force yourself watch first fifteen minutes their good chance you will make end smile your face,1
Pitch Perfect,take bring glee not icky cheesy way but because theres singing involved good kind mean girls add some quickwitted sharptongued dialogue commentary you have funniest movies,7
Pitch Perfect,first i leery movie about cappella singing groups i thought best would teen flick yes i know anna kendrick but bigger some better names have made some doozies but i unbelievably surprised every kind humour covered here done absolute perfection you will adopting many many lines into your daily lexicon,1
Pitch Perfect,me rebel wilson fat amy elizabeth banks gail commentator have some most hysterically smart lines ever committed celluloid right up there young frankenstein,1
Pitch Perfect,loved,1
Pitch Perfect,i never planning seeing particular movie after seeing unfortunate trailer however i had heard good things about people whos opinions i used trust i wont make mistake again pitch perfect awesomely terrible began innocently enough but then quickly devolved into mashup just about every single cliché one can fathom has loner girl who doesnt want try new things but then she gets involved group she has friends yay girl falls guy but she screws all up but dont worry they get back together end group starts out terrible but then because new girl fresh ideas they step up win all so many eye rolls one film,2
Pitch Perfect,even after worst part movie has awful sound mixing songs so doctored one painfully aware actors lip syncing takes you right out movie they could have least tried make sound like songs were being recorded live rather then using so much auto tune other forms voice manipulation,4
Pitch Perfect,then there were plethora jokes throughout fell so flat hurts some those jokes were even repeated multiple times because once wasnt bad enough least rebel wilson provides few brief moments relief onslaught worn out unfunny jokes,2
Pitch Perfect,but like thats just my opinion if you like terrible things like glee then you will probably love movie,1
Pitch Perfect,most people i saw pitch perfect truly enjoyed they laughed clapped booed me when i expressed my disgust many movie will definitely enjoyable make no mistake does not make any less awful movie,1
Pitch Perfect,several factors contribute my low opinion pitch perfect largest these concerns cast characters while there few complaints acting department characters themselves among worst set people committed screen recent memory,3
Pitch Perfect,beca spelling supposed hip something arrogant brooding selfish brat who spends most her time sulking her computer complaining about being forced go college people blegh right perfect setup character development right wrong after halfhearted apology being terrible human being before climax beca morphs not into upstanding social moral butterfly but smug leader troop she so recently kicked off image audience left,1
Pitch Perfect,jesse most cliché love interest one can imagine seriously girls if you ever meet guy perfect blameless marry him jesse prances throughout movie being sweet everybody his unrealistically nerdy roommate jerks he sings he pursues beca valiantly no particular reason provides cliché moral criticism beca so desperately needs late movie but course he takes her back while girls might enthralled sentiment no true development can occur through character who so blatantly onedimensional,2
Pitch Perfect,worst all two commentators singoffs gail john these two buffoons spew dialogue not only shockingly inappropriate televisionradio they simply arent funny while clearly trying channel fred willards comedic performance best show pair instead come across amusing your drunk middleaged parents frat party,1
Green Book,journey reawakening country like ours gore vidal called united states amnesia absurdity behavior southern communities even kindest ones have jarring effect viggo mortensen sheer perfection all american italian opening his heart his mind total joy mahershala ali provides another magnetic character his already rich list magnetic characters but what makes film fly so high humanity mortensen ali infuse their characters i loved them green book provided me one most satisfying endings 2018 leaves you hopeful thought perhaps were not there yet but we our way happy new year,8
Green Book,we loved green book along soldout crowd who applauded loudly end based true story piano virtuoso don shirleys road trip through south during 60s film pays tribute his genius courage black man who tries hard soar above ugliness times elegant trappings his home his success concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold lonely but his life begins change when he hires tony his road trip driver history nightclub bouncer mafia connections new york tony antithesis dons perfection their evolving relationship road makes movie soar above ordinary become magical viggo ali main roles remarkable its funny endearing watch them discard stereotypes discover their mutual humanity what we liked best movie teaches without preaching all unfolds through myriad natural moments between two great actors strong supporting cast top all off really good soundtrack excellent direction production values audience laughed out loud vigorously applauded endthis one true 10,10
Green Book,film proves why movies can so powerful touching poignant some times funny story opposites attract enjoyed every moment although isnt always easy watch mortenson ali shine there strong supporting roles well,10
Green Book,i saw don shirley perform college 1966 time i simply thought he hell pianist using bass cello come up unique sound so when movie came along i thought i saw guy i know critics being hard film but i sat two hours totally captivated i know there stereotypes could because repeated actions against minorities actions racists have become so commonplace they seem like stereotypes i believe performances these two fine actor made show there subtlety movie transcends many others its type yes there southern cops yes there mens rooms off limits yes there simplistic views racism white new yorkers but what i got realistic presentation evolving friendship shirley abrasive selfcentered lip clueless most time i believed them see film,10
Green Book,i saw premier tiff thrilled learn story about real friendship not typical road movie buddy film given lead actors i knew would something special entertaining funny parts hard accept others white american who wasnt around 1960s racism mind boggling i couldnt help but feel shame green book has so many layers family culture honesty dignity genius respect acceptance stereotypes racism music class friendship fried chicken whatever your views race age film not preachy but you should appreciate honest portrayal difficult time place history ill use term unlikely friendship but knowing two men were real makes fantastic im so grateful have learned about them their lives i only wish there had been qa afterward,9
Green Book,green book wonderful story overcoming selfcondemnation resulting freedom provides film begins tony locked prison judgment rejection not any conscious effort his own but rather his circumstances environment selfassured selfaware character dr shirley introduced into tonys life tony embarks journey selfdiscovery which he forced confront his own preconceived notions which ultimately stem his skewed view himself dr shirley helps tony see himself man beyond his own limiting thoughts tony finally able step into his true nature friend dr shirley everywhere film we reminded people complicated but beyond these complications we also reminded everyone same just looking love acceptance scene where dolores reads tonys letter her cousins spectacular regard its interesting none other reviews mention ymca scene aftermath which me pinnacle moment power shifted these two characters confronting their own strengths weaknesses film simply wonderful its portrayal humanity people we need our lives while comes light tonys wife dolores completely aware her husbands imperfections shortcomings she loves him just same but confrontation not love necessary bring about tonys redemption demonstrating people who spur us deep personal growth never who what we expect,10
Green Book,some my movie friends were stunned when i mentioned thread my peoples choice award vote tiff 2018 won btw i generally go weightier fare so my being won over pg13 road film familiar theycouldnthavebeenmoredifferent premise directed auteur coresponsible such recent classics dumb dumber three stooges elicited virtual doubletake,9
Green Book,but i couldnt help really best film i saw out 17 far away most entertaining i think largely because its based reallife story about beginning lifelong friendship story has writing participation son one reallife characters theres definitely air authenticity events they unfold could never occur purely contrived plot consider collegeeducated concert pianist jamaican descent hires temporarilyunemployed italianamerican nightclub bouncer whos streetwise but academically dim drive him venues deep south back 1962 thats not setup hollywood script written scratch would ever have come up,10
Green Book,two lead actors really click mahershala ali makes nice oscar followup playing aloof pianist passenger viggo mortensens bs artist driver ali certain get another nomination mortensens performance may little too broad garner one but he delivers exactly whats called he makes believable italianamerican which impressive considering hes danish,7
Green Book,im allergic preaching heavyhandedness movies no matter what message exception one borderline scene id say movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities surface so often sociallyconscious films,9
Green Book,music fx excellent when actor plays piano player theres always challenge making playing look believable doesnt get any better than gets here alis piano playing every bit convincing margot robbies ice skating i tonya you never see disconnect between hands body hes filmed against variety backgrounds if i could bet oscar win right now would kris bowers best original score he also supplies alis hands which should clinch,10
Green Book,top everything off capraesque christmas eve finale closing line sends everyone home smiling all adds up monster hit its commercial payoff could huge movie practically begs tv series spinoff reallife characters remained friends until they both died 2013,8
Green Book,so congratulations peter farrelly his graduation codirecting lowbrow fare solodirecting middlebrow ie massappeal fare you cant deny talent craftsmanship takes make mainstream movie works well one does,7
Green Book,picture should up best picture has everything great acting solid scriptwriting something hollywood really needs lots humor i wish hollywood would make more pictures like,10
Green Book,i understad why lot critics dont like film but same time i feel like theyre making up their minds about what they think movie should about they who disagree film will say diminishes horrors black community faced america during 50s because they think its bad film but i thought good film my opinion its not movie about shirley his struggles facing ruthless racism its about tony lips psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through witnessing shirleys experiences its central story line critics disagreeing eschews whole film premiss shouldve been about something else shirley journey not tonys,10
Green Book,there thousands if not millions films about racism towards black people their culture green book had different perspective than rest them not focusing racism but how racism changed man who wasnt target but thats obviously big nono according these critics,9
Green Book,me green book about white man thoroughly changing his whole mindset about something hed been condition abide his whole life,10
Green Book,very inspiring film i walked out cinema feeling like there good even unlikeliest people dialogue well written main characters were equally loveable viggo mortensens acting only overshadowed mahershala ali whose portrayal educated africanamerican man living 1960s america both heartwrenching absolutely hilarious while mortensen stood most comic relief i found myself laughing hardest alis deadpan deliveries through character dr shirley,7
Green Book,story black man who struggles gain respect his fellow africanamericans while simultaneously resisting pulling roots racism oppression which keeps him being successful americans europeans who should his equals all measures musical educational,10
Green Book,while story plot left little desired i felt one two jokes were shoehorned would have been better discarded visual tone fitting film but camerawork nothing out ordinary not all films call outofthisworld originality all marks however film allows audience focus what really important,10
Green Book,i saw tiff loved beginning end its moving true story about two people who forge unlikely friendship thoughtprovoking but never preachy,10
Green Book,outstanding true story film showing color doesnt define us but how we act ourselves towards others does,6
Green Book,great performances entire cast especially viggo mortensen mahershala ali who were perfectly cast convincing their roles also great see comedian sebastian maniscalco film well,8
Green Book,writer director producer peter farrelly nailed every aspect biography,9
Green Book,score cinematography sets visuals were all point,4
A Star Is Born,i did not want watch movie but took my wife see because we both saw one kris kristofferson barbra streisand growing up crowd lot older than we werewe almost 50 biggest screen they had our theater seats lot but maybe half full sunday afternoon not one dry eye place had great tempo didnt drag have any lulls story we were both very pleased still engaging conversations about movie its my opinion highly recommend everyone go out watch great movie heartfelt movie redefines love time age we live my two cents hope you enjoy much we have,10
A Star Is Born,good movie but not great movie will not popular opinion first good stuff lady gaga perfect role acting singing chemistry song writing all fantastic chemistry between bradley cooper gaga believable times breathtaking first two thirds movie had great arch captured us friend who watched movie me said i could watch first part movie repeat i am also big fan about 5 songs would add them my library without hesitation they beautifully written now not so good stuff last third movie too long could easily cut 20 minutes but bradley cooper director more than little self indulgent his own scenes we got struggle drawing out didnt serve storytelling allys character arch disappointing her star rose she didnt learn love what jack saw her she didnt learn take ownership her own story very gift jack trying give her allys story wasnt resolved until very last moments movie eclipsed bradleys directorial obsession jacks decline belying original premise all star born movies lessening her triumph i guess what moved great good me first two thirds proved could great but last third got hijacked no pun intended i give film 7 good out 10 musiccentric romantic drama,7
A Star Is Born,let me start saying performances solid not mind blowing but solid her first film lady gaga did very well but i cant say she blew my mindbut hey its her first film i like her so good her being said film seems getting way overblown people first act really great chemistry between gaga cooper phenomenal but after sort devolves into melodrama character development coopers character lacking he alcoholic we certainly see him drunk many times but i didnt see enough struggle justify his character arc not coopers performance powerful enough convey devastating agony addiction film then goes through few cliches we see gagas character ascend fame but again we also dont see enough struggle her character either all character conflicts addressed but film never fully dives into them way certainly could have i loved first song film but rest music surprisingly bland didnt captivate me all lady gaga obviously has incredible voice cooper held his own surprisingly overall good film not great just good,6
A Star Is Born,4th version star born ive seen 5th if you count what price hollywood each version had life their own reflected times time which made 2018 version no exception me represented also revelation lady gaga phenomenal film presence she quite simply superb moving powerful real janet gaynor had brought form overwhelming innocence judy garland exploded heartbreak hollywood doesnt exist anymore she unquestionably memorable barbara streisand tough strong sense self even during her tribulations lady gaga brings little each them well something profoundly personal kudos bradley cooper his norman maine has new name totally new presence times version seems more about him than about her any case i loved them both bravo,8
A Star Is Born,magnificent movie captivating performances bradley cooper lady gaga ultimate shock how brilliant lady gaga we knew she could sing but didnt have any idea just how far her acting talent stretches after watching i can tell you stretches far enough earn her some oscar gold movie outstanding music annoyingly perfect cast great everything shouts oscar worthy movie ten out ten,10
A Star Is Born,if youre even casual moviegoer chances you have already heard argument originality dead hollywood we live era where even ghostbusters no longer sacred where you wouldnt surprised if one large studios announced remake godfather citizen kane those remakes might capture some audience members but those films almost certainly dont capture audiences hearts they certainly dont capture praise critics they certainly dont take home any major awards,9
A Star Is Born,all changes star born,4
A Star Is Born,change however key word when comes remakes remakes remakes remakes order make venture worthwhile film makers not only have stay close ideas original film but they have have reason retell story its delicate balance every version star born follows broken celebrity winter his career damaged years drinking who suddenly reborn when meeting young ingénue two fall love but while their relationship develops their entertainment careers go different directions,4
A Star Is Born,director costar bradley coopers film seemingly borrows more streisandkristofferson iteration star born last time story retold dynamic between two lovers hinges music industry when streisand kristofferson remade film fourth time point 1976 they broke one aforementioned expectations they both took home golden globes their performances perhaps cooper more inspired performance rather than aesthetic acting one aspect out many shines coopers version characters jackson maine cooper ally lady gaga drive entire story what essentially film only half dozen notable characters cooper lady gaga have amazing chemistry moment you see two screen together first time you feel connection,5
A Star Is Born,first time director cooper deftly creates intimacy between jackson ally without which story would certainly not successful stadiums housing thousands fans small dressing rooms packed screaming drag queens loud dive bar parking lot allnightgrocer cooper uses tight framing sound impeccably make seem like theyre only two people world you understand his charm you see her vulnerability two actors give sidebyside stellar performances,7
A Star Is Born,isnt take away anything small but powerful supporting cast there were some brilliant surprising moments dave chappelle noodles old friend jacksons who reiterates how much ally has revitalized jackson largest surprise came andrew dice clay lorenzo allys father both clay chappelle brought great moments love humanity their criminally small interactions two main characters sam elliot also surprised me his role bobby jacksons much older brother they explain age discrepancy but rest selfexplanatory he cooper truly brothers screen all frustration fights familiarity goes relationship elliot his similarly small time screen often showed softer side his craft hiding touching instants sadness when comes his difficult relationship his brother concealed only slightly his iconic mustache,3
A Star Is Born,begs question does cooper deserve all praise director does cast what i can glean film cooper definitely had his cast same page regardless screen time these actors made you care about their characters audience invested there countless pivotal story beats where these characters may do something frustrating angering instead merely recognizing these hurdles push story further i found myself almost vocally upset akin yelling character horror film not go room where killer hiding film makes you want protagonists succeed even when dealing topical subplots regarding celebrity regret depression substance abuse,2
A Star Is Born,thats because youre along ride entire time youre part love story film sucks you beginning roar raucous concert audience hard beat drums jacksons stage his hypnotic swagger he plays thousands if you were one millions people who have seen trailer film im sure you know exactly what im talking about kudos promotional department film extremely engaging powerful trailer but stems extremely engaging powerful film music much like did trailer gets inside you not just inside your head where you find yourself humming gentle country lilt sang cooper gets inside your heart soul rattles around repeats over over until youre one who doesnt want let go while cooper should commended taking his craft seriously improving his singing where lady gaga shines no ones surprise,4
A Star Is Born,ally perfect role her performer has spoken about how vulnerable ugly she felt some scenes when shooting film but made her so real screen allys career much like first half film blasts off all you can do hold until you realize songstress belting powerful ballad you wonder much like her character how did we get here but point youre just happy along ride testament lady gagas ability because being such iconic figure if werent her conveyance sincerity humility characters journey would seem forced unfulfilling because gagas performance however you relish moment ally can finally embrace who she bravely belt out her songs no inhibition film so many moments grab you music undeniably one my favorite aspects i cant wait film get wider release so studio can also make soundtrack available,1
A Star Is Born,if when award season comes star born undeniably forerunner several major awards i think cooper should commended simply because director he brought everything together songwriters actors cinematography sound design superbly balanced create best possible version story making brightest star both critics audiences,4
A Star Is Born,im little lost how movie getting so many high reviews its good looking movie but characters relatively uninteresting best thing about music theyre not always singing,10
A Star Is Born,just seemed drag,5
A Star Is Born,i am more than just bit surprised how many imdb reviews just glow about remake another remake another remake yet still another remake case some people dont realize film has been over cooked since 1930s,1
A Star Is Born,maybe women love bradley cooper so his vanity project which he credited writer director star heck bradley cooper even went far having sam elliott voice over copying elliotts gravelly voice mr vanity cooper even gives himself several minutes solo face time singing pasthisprimetime weary weathered alcoholic singing star,1
A Star Is Born,oh sure cooper pulled out many pity points he possibly could including his loyal dog pining our over hill rock star while jack hides behind his closed garage door his dog rests front door resting alone waiting his master jack come out behind closed garage door awwwwww shucks coopers screenplay denotes sappy sucker tears called here,8
A Star Is Born,i wish hollywood would welcome some fresh new screenwriters blood some really creative ideas screenplays rather than just use bonafide stars rewrite old screenplays rehash old movies expect us avid filmgoers who enjoy going actual movie theaters suck old crap up again again,4
A Star Is Born,i bet more than half people who wrote praiseworthy imdb review 2018 film wont even remember who starred 5th version star born because simply not memorable film nor worthy bloated high praise has been garnering reference great pt barnum theres sucker born every minutedont next one pass overrated remake,1
A Star Is Born,only went because average rating imdb were very high i usually found them very reliable unfortunately time they were not good indicator its very average movie boring times poor actress performance lady gaga i do not comprehend how can rated above 610 honest,1
A Star Is Born,its story old time thats evident fact bradley coopers star born fourth yes fourth remake movie classic however clearly passionate directing acting throughout furthered wonderful music efficient portrayal classic ragstoriches story proves thoroughly entertaining memorable watch absolutely flies over course nearly two half hours,1
A Star Is Born,but before we get into all i have start films opening half hour which exceptional despite its long running time theres so much packed into opening act its delivered jawdropping passion energy point where i felt absolutely exhilarated film within such short period time,4
American Beauty,250 films ive seen rated imdb only one other schindlers list good american beauty film like not only entertains while youre theater but also drops subtle questions your head about nature human behavior gulf between fantasy reality after watching movie viewers will think long hard about their own lives well lives people around them movie spells out social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but cant really grasp,10
American Beauty,american beauty reminds us like lester we really have no idea what we really want were not rational creatures economists assume we our instinct might lead us perform one action yet our brains might tell us perform complete opposite we may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them lester may lust after angela yet once he feels her his hands finds out truth about her sexuality entirely different feeling comes over him,10
American Beauty,ricky fits drugdealing boy next door able look beyond conventional notions attractiveness find beauty nonpromiscuous solemn girls well plastic bags floating wind when many criticize movie they say wheres beauty plastic bag thats point we live world aesthetic subjectivism what one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet urge there people assume aesthetic absolutism its just plastic bag how can there beauty well human being just aggregation tissues bones blood how attractive depends how you look reality shaped perspective,10
American Beauty,some people criticize ricky fits character because he records his life experiences tape doesnt actually experience them but time moves inexorably one direction time cannot stopped physical sense past future dont exist we only conscious present everything we do everything we achieve every bit happiness we experience they all eventually buried past time recording subjective beauty means which one can attempt salvage beauty past into present because time eventually destroys all beauty if you dont believe me walk into preschool then walk into nursing home remember all old men women nursing home were once little kids,10
American Beauty,another profound element american beauty tag line look closer individuals behavior not independent his environment humans conformists nature humans will modify their behavior assimilate into existing social categories if any individual dares stray category which he has been assigned he shouted down ostracized no one can resist urge conform so why bother everyone nice public yet streets they blare their horns scream swear some boys i know pretend hate american beauty because surface seems like chick flick they force themselves watch gory horror movies show off others how they can stomach intense violence excessive sex scenes american beauty angela acts like total slut many girls seem nowadays end however she not what she makes herself out colonel fits tries act like such man yet end its all just giant facade civilization but one giant movie members society must start acting their parts if they want belong civilization otherwise theyre outsiders try walking into job interview without tie youll thrown out power convention,10
American Beauty,what if i asked you question what do you want life most people would say happiness but happiness worth deluding yourself carolyn burnham shields herself sadness adopting positivethinking philosophy philosophy selfaffirming mantras harsh selfdiscipline positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you reality wise moral change channel when you hear about mass starvation africa so you can enjoy moments fleeting happiness cheap romance movie selfhelp just euphemism selfdeception all humans need some complex fraud distract them harsh nihilistic realities life whether its religion money even love,10
American Beauty,spite american beautys greatness there problems characters stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless theyre ultracritical anyway exaggeration essential satire so certain points made obvious viewers furthermore alan balls original screenplay slightly edited ending more optimistic,10
American Beauty,problems aside sam mendes debut movie one greatest ive seen not only entertaining but also filled interesting ideas its important film society because theres so much society needs learn one boy i knew refused watch american beauty because he said im not gonna watch movie name like,10
American Beauty,look closer,10
American Beauty,10oct,10
American Beauty,film one kind after seeing film last week i left hole pit my stomach left many questions my mind most them cannot answered my view film makes me think after i watch secondtonone film certainly delivers aspect,10
American Beauty,i amazed vivid imagery movie well symbolism however what makes film best 1999 acting kevin spacey shines lester burnham annette bening carolyn burnham isnt far behind supporting cast members such wes bentley ricky fitts thora birch jane burnham mena suvari angela hayes chris cooper col frank fitts only add drama film i think most special aspect film how all characters intertwine way believable yet fantastic same time i congratulate sam mendes his direction film well alan ball writing i dont think could have been any better,10
American Beauty,rated r us strong sexuality language drug content violence film obviously deserves its rating however none causes r rating overbearing all them add plotline film while i dont think film children i would suggest adults should view open mind i believe traits which many characters film have found many people around world perhaps why film hits close home so many viewers,10
American Beauty,while billed some comedydrama i dont see anything about film funny sure there some comedic moments but end those moments were all but forgotten when faced grim reality conclusion events portrayed film,10

Mean Girls,my boyfriend has dvd so we put last night watched together still good has not dated all,8
Mean Girls,clique indeed mean one wonders whether high schools like today i graduated high school decade ago dont remember such mean environment but then again appeal story film,7
Mean Girls,girls really hot they flaunt gretchen prettiest me but course they all handpicked pretty especially during their stage show,9
Mean Girls,short funny mean sexy anyone who has attended high school bound identify some degree fun film,8
Mean Girls,film entertaining day i have watched half dozen times laugh feel burned every time over every viewing i feel film has fun characters cute girls good versus evil value driven watch again,9
Mean Girls,fun entertaining classic film sexy hip full attitude i love having said reading many reviews some claim realistic true high school culture i like know which schools these reviewers attended nothing like my high school i dont want them like one another i watch movies flights fantasy not realism unless documentary,9
Mean Girls,mean girls feels perfectly suited lindsay lohans talents new girl school cady heron who trying fit she extremely likable she becomes fast friends janis ian lizzy caplan who nails her performance if you not familiar singer janis ian check out her hit single seventeen damian daniel franzese but gets sucked into threegirls clique called plastics her allegiance split between two factions she finds herself becoming person she does not like,10
Mean Girls,film notable breakthrough performances rachel mcadams amanda seyfried mcadams plays regina queen plastics role similar many preceded but still holds up,8
Mean Girls,speaking precursors one might consider film ripoff others came before might considered merely referential perhaps homage but however you chose view has definite references breakfast club ferris buellers day off clueless risky business other john hughs films,9
Mean Girls,screenplay adaptation tina fey turns clever unsubtle but solid entry canon teen comedies,10
Mean Girls,film fun you laugh you get angry you enjoy show literally there one film sexy who doesnt like girls mini skirts well ok few do not legitimate reasons but most men do sex human body natural primordial eternal film gives you eye candy sweetness,9
Mean Girls,film engaging you interested characters actresses take their personas well plot moves along quickly,8
Mean Girls,movie easy one enjoy over over again i think how funny you find story relative your age someone newly out high school i can tell you high school clicks portrayed film bit farfetched i have never heard someone say you cant sit us being called too gay function movie still simply witty smart story line far different main stream movies come out today,8
Mean Girls,four nubile girls who bothered evocative put their nature good effect looking great id even tap very funny oneliners,7
Mean Girls,though my own high school days well behind me now film received enough acclaim i convinced give try mean girls did fact prove rewarding experience film made ton money launched some its young stars into orbit,7
Mean Girls,our story deals previously homeschooled girl lohan now having brave suburban high school first time she completely clueless far what takes cool new world but she pretty enough catch attention most popular girls school plastics they called take young lady into their world over time she becomes one them more popular young lady becomes more miserable her life becomes however,8
Mean Girls,film very funny hits pretty hard its depictions various cliques modern high schools some would argue characters film just stereotypes but so most real life high schoolers nearly everyone fit into one category another even back my school days but things seem even more fragmented now,8
Mean Girls,tina fey has written intelligent script thankfully film cast well enough carry lindsay lohan charming but nothing too exceptional rachel mcadams pretty much steals film she likely cast member who will have best career bunch i think its safe say her scream toward end act 2 best ive ever heard any filmlacey chabert also worth mentioning she seems worthy some better roles future overall there did not seem any casting problems,7
Mean Girls,mark watters keeps things moving along brisk pace seems strange see lorne michaels name credits any film funny what ive heard film had trimmed more than few parts would have given rrating boo hard argue box office totals though after watching film i reminded similar group popular girls my high school they called themselves senior bitch patrol behaved much same way plastics only back then 8891 mostly about hair bigger hair more popular girl all these girls have gone live boring pointless lives since those days go figure,8
Mean Girls,9 10 stars mean girls too bad i never had any math teachers pretty tina fey,5
BlacKkKlansman,amazing true story small team police infiltrating local klan chapter try stop looming violence,7
BlacKkKlansman,driver first class white undercover presence washington himself oozing presence throughout black officer who conceives plan runs show number hilarious high points gains respect trust big klan chief over phone,8
BlacKkKlansman,whilst there arguably room little bit trimming remains highly engaging throughout great script fine performances amazing trick here how lee seems very cleverly shift laugh out loud comedy troubling sometimes fairly intense scene back without missing beat,8
BlacKkKlansman,terrific spike lee film humor gut wrenching truths my first reaction villains were too one dimensional caricaturesque impossible stay them more than few seconds even outrageous scene connubial bliss where she expresses her willingness most romantic terms kill blacks i recoiled horror kind laughing nervously what satire then i realized real life villanis one dimensional they caricaturesque they their own satire john david washinton great sounds just like his father adam driver brings presence nothing short compelling final real life images devastating i highly recommend,6
BlacKkKlansman,my wife i watched home dvd our public library although runs bit long just over 2 hours such interesting story welltold never seemed too long,5
BlacKkKlansman,whole story based 2014 book ron stallworth his experiences 1970s colorado springs fresh police officer first black man position city character very well played john david washington real life stallworth had been achiever high school wanted make difference police officer,8
BlacKkKlansman,whim he notices ad which recruiting members new kkk chapter colorado springs area having phone voice speaking manner not easily identified black he successfully applied membership one point even speaking directly david duke new orleans,9
BlacKkKlansman,ron would not have gotten very far his ruse without white man replace him live encounters he recruited help fellow police officer adam driver flip zimmerman who happened jewish another ethnic target kkk together they thwarted some serious kkk mischief planned,8
BlacKkKlansman,very serious subject movie director spike lee injects fair share humor all very appropriate near end events 1970s intercut modern events protests showing white supremacy activities far over,3
BlacKkKlansman,spike lee has created almost unimaginably uneven career films but has never been doubt he one most talented american filmmakers his generation should you have forgotten now you can remind yourself watching amazing blackkklansman which won grand prix cannes may,4
BlacKkKlansman,blackkklansman tells true story rookie african american police officer who 70s infiltrated kkk but thats certainly not what movie about lee tackles headon contemporary hot topics racism police killing black americans white supremacy create overwhelming pamphlet about american identity which has been hurled into state great confusion after last presidential election,6
BlacKkKlansman,movies dont come much more political one way blackkklansman companion piece post movie similarly discussed current political climate 70s setting but loads more blackness humour anger attitude its better movie too,5
BlacKkKlansman,though not perfect formwise blackkklansman sometimes paced oddly feels needlessly long not overlong exactly because youre not going bored minute visually could have used little more delicious textures typical those 70s blacksploitations makes references,6
BlacKkKlansman,but lee such virile storyteller you cant help but get sucked all he has so much say blackkklansman its savage best when putting perspective official holierthanthou image white americans harry belafonte cameos eyewitness beastly lynching jesse washington 1916,3
BlacKkKlansman,actors blackkklansman great john david washington excels lead role adam driver signs what arguably his best role date ryan eggold terrific local boss kkk finnish jasper pääkkönen impresses his right hand man biggest surprise all topher grace who nearingenious david duke wellmannered bag sleaze threepiece,4
BlacKkKlansman,blackkklansman incredibly rich stirring piece contemporary cinema enough stuff fuel conversation hours days you can get lot less price movie ticket these days,2
BlacKkKlansman,theres much good about movie starting ron stallworths incredible deception klu klux klan racism all its ugliness powerfully shown theres lot humor expense some really dumb people unfortunately theres lot wrong movie too most because director embellished true story im not big fan directors tinkering what really happened order add their own touch then still claim based true story result tinkering very uneven movie particularly apparently easy parts infiltrating kkk hard parts where things go wrong easy parts remarkably mostly true story apparently wasnt dramatic enough so lot fictional hard parts were added build tension including whole characters situations thats bad enough but added parts often made no sense such having no real origin like one characters intense suspicions no resolution dilemma presented they just seem go away forgotten have no effect inevitable story arc many seem have been thrown only make already duped people look even more ridiculous characters themselves few exceptions just caricatures its not hard figure out whats next since they do exactly what you expect eventually movie just got boring since all moved inevitable very easy see end ultimately movie maybe hour amazing true humorous story marred over hour superfluous poorly executed fiction,1
BlacKkKlansman,ive generally liked spike lee films over years i had high expectations one given awards many negative reviews have already covered issues pacing writing editing which i generally agree person whos been antiracism activist my entire life i felt film heavy handed propagandist if woke person can feel heavy handed imagine how those not board topic can totally feel propagandised how futile regards effectiveness creating social change point marketing speaking points ridiculous opening line about being based true story so many reviews here state their amazement how impressed they jewish person black person working together like lie there no jewish partner book completely fictionalised furthermore confounding race issues religious issues truly non starter but most film fictionalised majority book about his undercover work against black activists which he spent over three years given actual facts laid out book film really goes down ratings false marketing saddest statement about our society when people more interested virtuesignalling than truth had production values been better least might have been enjoyable stand alone without pretence being based book but i kept falling asleep idiot conversations droned endlessly completely took me out film so its fail both production values truth high rating says lot about how important virtuesignalling has become our society,3
BlacKkKlansman,hi im french im 16 we saw movie cinema my english class our english teacher asked us write revue movie after put website blackkklansman movie birected spike lee 2018 film based true story ron stallworth black police officer who wanted infiltrate kkk inspired book spike lee made film movie we have funny moments romance too ron falls love patrice beautiful blanck woman who fights racism certainly top od my list good movies because not only about racism but about several kinds discrimination antisemitism gender inequality so i think lot people can indentify both characters realise discrimination must fought i think spike lee did good work because hemanaged make making comedy dramatic issue adam driver john david washington have really good actors game couldnt other actors so yes i think film compelling convincing realistic startling funny dont miss there lot reseach film director about kkk who secret organisation white supremacists directed donald duke created 1865 after civil war war between northen southen states usa north wanted abolish slavery south didnt movie we can also see kkk rites white costums all tradition i really enjoyed because you get out less stupid than you were before seeing film,10
BlacKkKlansman,conclusion its fantastic film good actors top you learn lot about discrimination humanity but funny moments well its hit freat piece filmmaking go see,2
BlacKkKlansman,good work mr spike lee,3

Avengers: Age of Ultron,spoiler free review let me first start saying i am not marvel fanboy dc nerd comic book genre films have made my personal top 3 favourite genres last decade mcu has been strong contributor rise i hold first ironman first avengers captain america 12 high regard i did not like direction they took iron man 3 more below guardians galaxy but winter soldier gem terms balancing solid action drama levity,6
Avengers: Age of Ultron,being said my initial thoughts age ultron aou quite negative me its essentially carbon copy im3 there problems which strike you repeatedly you progress throughout film 2 biggest complaints i have aou 1 tone comedy 2 scriptwriting,10
Avengers: Age of Ultron,so starting tone i like laugh im sure most people do but there time place exhibit your comedy writing skills action film aou its constant recurring predictable theme its not limited one character either everyone popping one liner jokes if its expendables yes most not funny timing these moments levity horrible too desensitising viewer any impending fear death battle if characters seem so relaxed not worrying about possibly dying then what suspense needed held audience plagued im3 bad way its arguably worse here comic book films which achieved great success regard were xmen dofp avengers 1 cap 2 even dark knight rises can you imagine climax xmen dofp if old magneto storm bishop start pulling one liner jokes army sentinels came charging them would kill any tension 2 script i wont say too much since spoiler free review but really feels rushed unorganised i watched fast 7 around 2 weeks before aou i got similar vibes again its not fact film 25 hours long has too many characters isnt am excuse since dark knight xmen dofp shows how navigate these theatrical obstacles there few completely unnecessary subplots aou useless characters which do not impact story overall villain himself ultron another massive letdown marvels already growing catalogue mishandled villains,7
Avengers: Age of Ultron,so summary if you want mindless action cool cgi which film does offer form some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like aou if you after darker grounded more moving story like trailers promised you will severely disappointed final score 610 i am being kind since cap my fav avenger they finally gave him some good screen time,6
Avengers: Age of Ultron,avengers age ultron 2015 marvel damn good superhero flick excellent sequel yes miles way better than jurassic world star wars force awakens terminator genisys i have enjoyed film much better than jurassic world star wars terminator new movies,5
Avengers: Age of Ultron,film fun popcorn action entertaining action sequel flick i like first one but i love one much more first time i watch i did not like film all did not work me but second time around flick awesome become one my favorite marvel superhero movies i love film so much more than first avengers james spader made movie me so much better than loki,9
Avengers: Age of Ultron,james spader robert downey jr played together teen movie tuff turf 1985 30 years later they teamed together star marvel comic book super hero film i like tuff turf but avengers age ultron far way better film me i love film so much i will never get backlash joss whedon gave me everything i wanted sequel first film my top 10 films all time,8
Avengers: Age of Ultron,i waited long time universe i am loving every minute superhero movies come out all time but something like what i love about movies,5
Avengers: Age of Ultron,plot tony stark creates ultron program protect world but when peacekeeping program becomes hostile avengers go into action try defeat virtually impossible enemys get earths mightiest heroes must come together once again protect world global extinction,3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,i really enjoy movie i dont get backslash lot people were disappointed sequel not so good first film age ultron my top 3 favorite comic book films number 1 will always captain america winter soldier number 2 will captain america first avenger i just love those two films captain america my favorite superhero character marvel comic books,4
Avengers: Age of Ultron,captain america movie most decent hero movie he did not want leave island people stuck he refused too i have seen hero him,8
Avengers: Age of Ultron,people keep getting upset over black widow scarlett johansson oh look what they did black widow i saw film i am seeing her kicking ass calm down hulk which pretty ballsy thing do specially someone who has no balls she kicking ass driving motorcycle driving around shooting cap helping them get vision android beat ultron she only one no powers except hawkeye jeremy renner she has get thing them i think would weird kidnapped thor if you put thor scene duh i enjoy movie much more than first film first film i liked okay i like first avengers film fun popcorn entertainment flick i really love,10
Avengers: Age of Ultron,i like romance between black widow hulk really good fast paced entertainment i love elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch i like twist end film she turn her side around when she found out ultron wants destroy everything planet i love you have aaron taylorjohnson kickass film pietro maximoff quicksilver sadly he dies end film but he saves hawkeye kid ultron firing bunch bullets them i thought pretty decent film my opinion aaron taylorjohnson did good job playing his character i love they return samuel l jackson movie back nick fury he help them out fighting ultron james spader did terrific excellent job playing ultron,1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,avengers age ultron 2015 american superhero film based marvel comics superhero team avengers produced marvel studios distributed walt disney studios motion pictures sequel 2012s avengers eleventh film marvel cinematic universe mcu,3
Avengers: Age of Ultron,you have lot action i also love tony stark steve rogers thor bruce banner hulk natasha romanoff clint barton work together after ultron failed destroy them they go safe house clintons family i like when scarlet witch elizabeth olsen touches black widow iron man thor i like you see background natasha romanoffs childhood i like i love african shipyard you see them ship i love last stand i love vision helps avengers destroy stop ultron extinction btw i love death black widow natasha romanoff scarlett johansson she so beautiful charming i love her overall i am giving flick 10 out 10 me age ultron my 3 favorite super hero movie i cant wait next movie captain america civil war,9
Avengers: Age of Ultron,task bringing together earths mightiest heroes took joss whedon into uncharted territory 2012s avengers despite weight marvel cinematic universe his shoulders results were staggeringly entertaining task making sequel groundbreaking monumental event film however being expected deliver par better results entirely different beast,7
Avengers: Age of Ultron,avengers age ultron definitely built bullet point takeaways avengers which make time space wit banter humor sake humor prevent film taking itself too seriously give each character story arch independent moments choreography clever action sequences welltimed glory shots these components full force ultron make enjoying blockbuster easy shoving lollipop your mouth,10
Avengers: Age of Ultron,yet ultron infinitely more complex than its predecessor number heroes featured barely fits into single action figure play case meaning more subplots back story addition creating arch creation life ultron itself plot takes avengers eastern european country sokovia new york african nation wakanda seoul south korea sokovia again much age ultron nonstop blur,9
Avengers: Age of Ultron,film opens avengers leading assault secret hydra facility where they have located staff loki used lead chitauri invasion avengers when they secure bring back new york tony stark robert downey jr bruce banner mark ruffalo discover its power source contains blueprint artificial intelligence which would allow stark proceed his ultron project initiative create peacekeeping robots could defend world place avengers should another alien invasion occur when ultron voiced james spader becomes conscious however he interprets his peacekeeping instructions imperative wipe out humankind,10
Avengers: Age of Ultron,added mix maximoff twins pietro aaron taylorjohnson wanda elizabeth olsen – also known quicksilver scarlet witch – who decide serve ultron latter using her powers give each avengers dangerous visions could tear them apart,1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,fight scenes action sequences such abundance ultron its impossible remember them all ones most distinct such iron man chasing down taming rampant hulk using his hulkbuster armor ancillary narrative finding what ultron up stopping other words – its all show creativity fight choreography also gets lost whirlwind action captain america chris evans probably does 12 different awesome things his shield but they happen so fast youll hard pressed recall any one them detail really clever sequences only fun buildup payoff those pieces given no time breathe,10
Avengers: Age of Ultron,whedon does allow pauses chaos such swanky avengers tower party featuring films best scene when each avenger tries his hand lifting thors hammer quiet retreat unexpected safe house countryside but its simply trade off instead busy action sequences we get character relationship dynamics back story,1
Avengers: Age of Ultron,ultron inundating frank but everythingbutthesink mentality its carried its sense humor cast whose members have each proved themselves time again magnetic both their own part team some novelty has worn off but seeing all these characters together remains treat even most convoluted stories cannot entirely dismantle marvel studios truly proves ultron credibility has built fans point even when gets little ambitious mettles bit more you can easily see whedon odds them final cut its reputation remains intact fans placated,10
Avengers: Age of Ultron,phase iii begins adding even more characters marvels cinematic universe even sliding spiderman into mix en route twopart avengers infinity war slated 2018 2019 will interesting see if marvel studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos reins touch either way should fun,3
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,franchise has obviously become parody seems very high number worlds population serve high table theyre everywhere behind every corner but they cannot kill one single man even if they stab shoot throw him hotel roof hit him car full speed head powerful organization lives among camels african desert there some entertaining moments however numerous fighting scenes become dull after while,6
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,i liked first two movies both had meaning behind all action takes place movie plot weak fight scenes way too long weak plot keanu still portrays his character boogeyman really well i enjoyed but just felt dragged bit much fight scene especially halle could have been cut down,6
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,hollow plot interspersed most boring fighting scenes ever dozens dozens inept villains who there just shoot gone fresh sequences first movie superuninteresting main villain very poor climax twists just sake twists seems like theres nobody out there capable writing movie anymore,2
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,films like watching someone else play video game someone has put immortality cheat after 1520 minutes its dull repetitive then ultimately stupid lacking any humanity,1
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,apparently people only use one hand fight actually look like they waiting until they allowed punch main character super unrealistic when compared first two movies way too staged good action film also hale berry has handgun 67 bullets some point,2
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,so first review ive wrote anyway i dont know where these people coming call movie exciting nonstop incredible omg etc clear i loved first john wick second one me eh because got really silly whole high table medallions basically everyone world contract killer etc john wick 3 basically second one only pcp,4

John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,dont get me wrong i love action movies like i said i loved first one without good story though its just silly after about 4550 minutes you literally start shaking your head because just becomes really repetitive friend mine asked me how movie afterward can summed up everyone goes after wick everyone dies end movie also left wide open sequel which just blew my mind just stop movie equivalent someone who playing gta3 their first time just running around shooting killing everything moves,1
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,universe created without any source material had develop expand itself every new film same fiction can not made each film we dont know if derek kolstad had thought john wick would big when he first created but when we came third film seems clear how story deepened became beautiful,1
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,film offers you all kinds action film has unique style action any action you can think included third film moreover exponentially enemies increasingly jumping we saw trailer there even horse escape scene theres so much more point sometimes there can small illusion viewer only actionoriented films can considered empty we can say john wick 3 offers almost uninterrupted action 2 hours 10 minutes but doing so doesnt forget story you will learn new very interesting details john wick you will get new ideas about functioning universe,3
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,stahelski has very impressive shotsthe main venues preferred main fights were especially appreciated fact directors vision so blended keanu reeves other actors very effective traceability film stahelski deserves great praise,1
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,film also brings new characters one them sofia played halle berry obviously audience will love sofia halle berry has done great job mark dacascos one our main villains he portrayed character zero film,5
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,among action films both strong story ambitious way action i think actionlovers will pleasure separated film 910,3

John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,i enjoyed first two installments john wick franchise so looking forward movie ive walked out three movies my life one nearly number four had i not been there my 19yearold son who seemed enjoying me nothing more than watching someone play first person shooter video game,10
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,there no story there no character development while fight scenes were well done they were too long too frequent frankly they were boring,2
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,movie painfully boring,1

John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,maybe my review will not relevant everyone i crave more inner consistency movie which completely lacked here i mean gruesomely kill several people packed new york subway no one notices thing bodies disappear when angle switched come,6
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,whole movie had huge ultraviolet feeling just pile random characters then slaughter most them without much development explanation how they fit plot rush somewhere kill everyone sight cut next scene which just same last one over over over until cliche end which just opening chapter 4 movie,6
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,i loved first one second one bit over top one just ridiculous top bottom movie actually interrupted because some false alarm theatre five minutes before end if more than we would not bother going back finish watching,10
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,biggest joke itself character zero moment bench felt like cut out despicable me only thing missing there squid launcher he supposed toughest thug movie pull other one has bells,9

Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,when comes down aurora has very little trust maleficent her own godmother people die some close her she goes receive her grand wedding what kinda story,5
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,new conflict these days movie making good sometimes even excellent visuals against boring bad script whole movie tastes like stale beer whereas people responsible visuals effects have developed high skills most todays writers should just quit their job serve dinners instead torturing audiences braindead level uninteresting overused storylines cliché after cliché one dimensional characters boring dialogues jokes dont work etc my rate 5 but only because visuals actors story itself therefore movie simply boring one,5
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,writing not good enough visual amazing so acting but script really bad,4
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,awful pacing sooooooo slow effects were decent michelle pfeifer angelina jolie were good their roles however friends were dying around main characters left right but no one showed emotion one auntie fairies sacrificed herself but aurora ignored fact chose have wedding less than hour later traitorous fairy who doing nazi style experiments others murdering them not only left free but attended wedding guest what kind soulless characters these people how inauthentic writing,3
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,rating 7210 maleficent not bad movie but certainly isnt one disneys best good acting performance michelle pfeiffer aka queen ingrith she really did i really like acting anjelina jolie well she perfect role if you like fairytale movie you will enjoy maleficent,7
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,first all i have say i am big fan first movie despite all its flaws i am sad see franchise such great potential ruined so badly i wish i didnt have write review but seeing all positivity being spread around made me want share bit objective criticism,4
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,there three main issues movie poke my nerve really badly,4
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,firstly trailer title both very misleading luring adult audience into thinking maleficent will go through jokerlike phase actually do some evil well evilest thing we got stopping cat midair threatening kill far im concerned she didnt even kill queen who actually deserved just because aurora gets way what evil we even talking about,1
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,second thing bothers me trying base childrens movie war genocide i dont know who ever thought but those two things just dont work together everything sugarcoated absolutely no realism presented throughout movie literally no one thought two kingdoms could come together except phillip aurora idealistic naive couple no experience real world politics beginning movie actually joke writes itself moreover elf has been aggressive throughout whole movie suddenly stops after few kind words enemy prince give me break there just so many plot incoveniences stem trying make adult themes appropriate children turns movie into parody rather than believable story,9
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,lastly writing just bad i cant get over fact maleficent has been guarding aurora her whole life girl decides believe queen she met five minutes ago phillip utterly useless he couldnt even tell court people maleficent doesnt stand iron also remember curse first movie apparently cant broken well not thing anymore,2
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,there few words can describe disappointment i felt after maleficent resurrected herself top tower finally i thought when she died there plot twist we were waiting but no because protagonist childrens movie simply cant die together immortality maleficent gained she also lost large chunk her character future potential remember jolies expression when maleficent found our her wings were cut off first movie scene gave me chills now when maleficent practically untouchable question whether we will get great scene like anymore,4
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,lets talk about queen my opinion she probably most developed character whole movie yes she may evil but her motivation point her hatred towards moor justified strategy conquer almost flawless she only character besides maleficent understands complexity politics has no problem putting phillip his rightful place since childrens movie i honestly expected her die well stefan did first movie but they didnt even do they just turned her into goat way pfeiffers cold face suits role perfectly costumography absolutely stunning,3
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,if i had choose one scene stuck me most would definitely dinner little do we know about queen until then but way she makes maleficent uncomfortable quickly clearly lets us know what kind foe she angelina michelle both did astounding job portraying their respective characters true pleasure feel onscreen tension between them,1
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,summarize maleficent mistress evil movie stripped away its dignity writers who clearly do not understand war not theme appropriate children much i loved first movie i wouldnt recommend one anyone interested more than two hours fun hopefully disney will one day start caring about quality their movies rather than making money such shame,7
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,ill start off saying film looks beautiful but where ends film has some serious story problems tries game thrones children but falls very flat due its 2 hour run time despite film being called maleficent mistress evil there very little maleficent film short period time she she definitely isnt evil michelle pfeiffer great villian glue holds film together end film massive battle huge body count resolved within minutes because wedding good see if your huge disney fan but its not worth going out your way see,7
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,im sorry i get turned off when teenage airhead causes more trouble than she worth she runs every scene just get way annoying over over its too much,3
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,dont listen critics reviews fun entertaining watch doesnt quite have same impact first but i still recommend watchingpurchasing,2
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,i recommend you if you have 1012 years old daughter who never watched fantasy movie before you dont mind suffering through fancy garbage,1
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,looks beautiful descent acting yeah i mentioned all good things about movie story so cliché predictable i felt like saw 1000 times before sooo slow i waited real stuff long time when happened i suffering waiting end maleficent sacrificed herself save princess spolier she didnt die lol she transformed into big bird some reason than suddenly everyone stopped fighting lived peace forever yes you right ending every second fantasy movie made after 2000 if you read like good movies make yourself favour dont watch,9
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,battle scene bought down movie complete drag too one sided major part not sure if screenplay writers were aware parents dont bring kids disney movies watch prolonged bio genocides,1
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,so basically michelle pfeiffer gets do whatever she wants including biological warfaregenocide no consequence we should all unreasonably forgiving,9
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,i just dont understand how her characters able f everyone over over again aurora does nothing but cries pretends useful prince isjust prince maleficent barely manages save day cost whole lot magical creatures lives because she arrives late gets killed basically no reason reborn yes you read right seemingly resaves day yet unable undo any death turns castle flowery everybody rejoice hug your enemies never mind blue fairy now just pot flower half nearextinct dark feys gone,1
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,i literally cringed entire 23 movie because how oblivious everyone its like nobody gives damn about what just happened probably hundreds innocents were killed but perpetrator now goat ha ha most socalled plot laughable like unfunny goat tropes played out conveniences forced romances,2
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,1 whole we dark feys have been hiding here less than hour away like less convincing rerun how train your dragon 2 maleficent realizes her phoenix force after black man sacrifices himself resulting her flirting reckless white boy who still alive 3 one human soldiers who did most killings checks out rainforestfey lady 10 minutes after her partner got killedshe likes reciprocates,4
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,movie leaves really bad taste my mouth ending so forced everybody so blatantly happy despite tragedymakes me wanna puke all over disney,3

Shutter Island,i think john anderson wall street journal got right when he says film,10
Shutter Island,requires multiple viewings fully realized work art its process more important than its story its structure more important than almost perfunctory plot twists perpetrates its thriller crime story tortured psychological parable about collective guilt,10
Shutter Island,shutter island story teddy daniels us federal marshal sent island his partner chuck aule search disappearance patient each scene provides turn against their leads compels them look more whilst searching places we couldnt comprehend including their minds leonardo dicaprio mark ruffalo feed off each other supply great performances their characters expected but some other characters whose names riveted posters marquees sensational well two stuck out me most were ben kingsley dr cawley michelle williams dolores teddys wife each whom brought so much dramatics new questions movie developing plot twists controversy i dont think film would same without them,9

Shutter Island,shutter island film will divide film community film will leave many upset hating film has already completely split critics movie messes you no one likes messed exactly where exceeds think im contradicting myself,8
Shutter Island,shutter island one most well crafted psychological thrillers come since silence lambs no coincidence both were brilliantly written novels shutter island adapted book written dennis lehane wrote gone baby gone mystic river book filled twists turns will leave reader dizzy what its film counterpart does fullest martin scorsese helms director chair movie where he more free than any before scorsese his most unrestrained,9
Shutter Island,marty takes what he has learned great films past puts into his master suspense alfred hitchcocks influence everywhere you look film no wonder considering scorsese even showed one his greatest works crew vertigo many those ideas present shutter island cliff scenes scream hitchcock film creeps crawls filled dark corners all heightened coming storm looms over island classic film noir,10
Shutter Island,story follows teddy federal marshall his partner chuck played dicaprio ruffulo they go mysterious island enveloped fog investigate escape these opening scenes marty has set up dark creepy premise,9
Shutter Island,almost whole movie incorporates story teddy desperately tries find truths he seeks teddy shown scared man man war violence portrayed various flashbacks these will go increasingly important story progresses we follow teddy his quest through every dark corridor perilous confrontations slowly we given pieces puzzle but audience does not even realize we like teddy blind moment least because thrilling conclusion will leave many blindsided but you see where thriller becomes something more we audience put teddys shoes we feel all things he feels complete assault senses works beautifully,10

Shutter Island,also film i would recommend seeing second time fact even better second time all those pieces puzzle you didnt catch first time you will second you see we audience first put shoes teddy second well without giving too much away lets just say you put someones elses shoes entirely during second viewing,9
Shutter Island,shutter island film will make you question your own sanity film will leave you breathless film has reignited thriller genre film will leave you main character searching answers,10
Shutter Island,10 out 10,10
Shutter Island,name,8
Shutter Island,one best movies made director martin scorsese perhaps best movie starring leonardo dicaprio honestly speaking one greatest films decade dicaprio featured two movies 2010 other one being inception both were excellent day they some best cinematic experience i have ever had being said i found shutter island much more superior inception feels little bit mumbo jumbo many times,8
Shutter Island,good shutter island simply masterpiece beginning movie suggests very basic plot detective story possibly thriller movie progresses plot becomes bigger bigger more more complexity added way happens incredible pacing really good what makes movie so interesting even though movie gets more complex not difficult keep up major plot points final twist one best plot twists i have ever seen i did not expect all like main character portrayed dicaprio we not ready believe what being told until lot reveals finally convince us there lot many things might seem pointless before final twist which totally relevant story actually being told character edward daniels superbly written we get know where character coming we can get behind character yet another excellent thing about movie there some dream sequences seems like filler but major indication reveal there quite many illusions which feel very real but carry no real meaning end there many additional things which may seem like diversion story being told but actually enhancing some dialogues between main character imprisoned character get very different interpretation after its all set done so much complex story yet no giant inconsistencies all its just superbly written directed acted its totally different memento 2000 but still has lot similarities we get into main characters head we just get his interpretations different types though towards end we dont want step fully outside his head but when we finally do its mind blowing ending moments were conceived many confusing but if you keep up entire story its meaning quite obvious movie dark psychologically engrossing yet does have short lived very brief happy moment tiny plotline involving dr cawleys motives thats all i can say without getting into complete spoilers leonardo dicaprio mark ruffalo ben kingsly have given some great performances till date i dont have anything bugged me so no mixed bad aspects film,9
Shutter Island,conclusion whole me its movie decade decade almost over still i have not got any movie league shutter island its very engaging thrilling movie its one those films i consider all time great,9
Shutter Island,rating score absolute 1010 grade,10
Shutter Island,visually beautiful wonderfully acted relentlessly gripping shutter island brilliantly unrestrained psychological thriller keeps its audience riveted throughout its entire duration,6
Shutter Island,there one line dialogue right end shutter island before credits roll elevates emotion film makes much more powerful those you like me who read enjoyed novel before seeing film felt trailers advertisements film were leading you believe there wouldnt any narrative surprises store think again scorseses film features one brief piece dialogue films conclusion results entirely different perception final act rest film however very faithful dennis lehanes already great story,4
Shutter Island,shutter island represents exactly what one should hope when seeing novel being interpreted film while certainly does source material justice also adds small changes make distinctive experience even if youve read novel multiple times youll feel like youre reading book first time again while watching scorsese perfectly recreates menacing atmosphere island film every location foreboding drenched hints unseen danger dark corners lighthouse caves civil war fort housing most dangerous patients island itselfevery locale seems large yet claustrophobic isolated same time,1
The Deer Hunter,i will not repeat much comments previous positive reviews but will stick mostly how movie affected me first off i am army veteran vietnam war thus there much picture deeply moves me i still can not listen theme music piece played john williams cavatina without choking up weeping,10
The Deer Hunter,i identify much characters movie i grew up very small town come working class norwegian scotsirish english background two weeks out high school age 17 i enlisted army like men movie i came tradition serving ones country military both my brother two cousins my future brotherinlaw also served vietnam war,10
The Deer Hunter,i identify michael played robert deniro his sense honor going back nam trying bring back his buddy nick additionally i admire mike when he visits steven va hospital brings him back home honor mentioned movie rob roy gift man gives himself michael movie doesnt waste time whether war vietnam right wrong michael just does what he thinks right respect his buddies ask any one who has served military they will tell you youre sense commitment your comrades almost takes precedence over your commitment your country,10
The Deer Hunter,i do not see movie either pro antivietnam war me movie portrays how war affects three individuals movie about character honor loyaltywhat you when everything around you falling apart i will continue see movie many times i hope values depicted will still reflected albeit weakly me,10
The Deer Hunter,closing i can not help remember politically antivietnam war movie coming home starring jane fonda jon voight also up same oscars when jane fonda asked what movie would win academy award year she sneeringly replied she hoped wasnt deer hunter years since jon voght has transitioned being liberal conservative parenthetically jane fonda has never apologized her proviet cong actions age 66 i am still proud i served my country volunteered us army vietnam war,10
The Deer Hunter,i am combat veteran afghanistan,9
The Deer Hunter,we dont know why some us come back others do not war gamble,9
The Deer Hunter,film deeply touched my soul,10
The Deer Hunter,deer hunter 32 years old how extraordinary sit through now walking over politics divided somehow all its admirers then great film but how silly think now michael sensational young robert de niro extreme character rocco rocco his brothers his goodness one always there but he discovers under most horrendous circumstances underlined stanley mayerss cavatina permeates entire film i remember thinking when i saw film first time i couldnt wouldnt spend ten minutes michael his friends ones we meet beginning film but end i thought them brothers i loved them i actually loved them itself sort film miracle john savage will break your heart certainly broke mine christopher walken absolutely riveting how strange tho think michael cimino still young man nowhere seen still punishment heavens gate indecent exposure there something else we dont know about cimino behind deer hunter true master,10
The Deer Hunter,no not best film about vietnam war its hardly about vietnam all vets who dont like have wrong do vietnamese who found racist could any war any combatants but because primary victims here recognizable american archetypes americans will feel their gut more than any other war film i know one very few postwar hollywood films shows sincere reverence lives small town americans,10
The Deer Hunter,after seeing very high quality theater its initial release i walked out thinking easily one best movies i had ever seen i never wanted see again but i looked today cable found not much had changed about me i dont want see againbut i want you see,10
The Deer Hunter,even now russian roulette scene context people watch all comes before first single most intense sequence ive seen makes end reservoir dogs seem like cartoon best walken performance period meryl streep glows deniro has seldom been more affecting unique classicit not surprising cimino didnt have another movie him after something wrenching,8
The Deer Hunter,comment re other comments lot comments criticize first half hour being too long my opinion these comments miss point movie,10
The Deer Hunter,course many scenes first hour dont advance narrative theyre not supposed theyre character development,9
The Deer Hunter,whole point movie show us how various characters were affected war wouldnt have worked nearly powerfully does had first hour been trimmed down we have sense careless fratboylike immaturity these young men thats why scenes all revolve around frivolity seemingly senseless boyish behavior creates such stark contrast devastated characters three who went war relatively unaffected personalities those who stayed behind like stanley,10
The Deer Hunter,strong points film outstanding performances nearly every actor movie yes there technical deficiencies sound but hardly matters nitpicking compared overall construction film,1
The Deer Hunter,1978s deer hunter one more polarizing movies come out during 1970s first movie deeply controversial subject vietnam war both become critical commercial success however there were several people who expressed dissent ranging its portrayal vietnam war controversial involvement russian roulette singing god bless america i remember not being too impressed film first time i viewed i felt too long violent years later i am singing different tune its difficult film sit through because its violence effects ptsd posttrauma syndrome but highly engaging effective film i regard one more influential american movies 1970s not best but most influential because there will more successful films tackling vietnam war horizon,1
The Deer Hunter,you can call movie symphony some sort i sort film into three major segments first segment longest because its lengthy effective characterization we meet three pennsylvania factory workers michael robert de niro steven john savage nick christopher walken they enlisted army serve vietnam steven decides marry before going off war wedding also serves farewell party section eerily reminiscent opening act godfather there lots partying dancing we essentially get know these characters these men hard workers who get drunk party because they deserve night themselves after party trio friends along another friend stan john cazale go into mountains hunt deer one last trip hence title movie i found section incredibly effective characterbuilding director michael cimino took his time his part because important understand these men before they go into horrors war,1
The Deer Hunter,second movement our symphony actual war just like loud noise film instantly changes its tone foggy mountains pennsylvania tropical war zone vietnam we go one most terrifying sequences ever made three men taken prisoner forced play russian roulette while their captors betting who will win who will die just seeing mens faces they waiting their turn ratinfested cages undeniably scary one films controversies roulette not actually played vietnam according cimino he read articles saying they did play roulette although any has not been confirmed but its one hell way add tension movie you can also take symbol war overall roger ebert puts perfectly his review anything you can believe about game about its deliberately random violence about how touches sanity men forced play will apply war whole essentially violence stands war itself what these men face,10
The Deer Hunter,now our final act symphony what happens after horrors prison camp michael becomes prominent character here he returns home welcomed hero his townsfolk his girlfriend linda meryl streep but michael does not feel like hero steven hospital after losing his legs nick somewhere vietnam still michael eventually goes back find nick who happened take his roulette experiences heart playing game professionally section incredibly sad moving here we see what exactly war can do strongwilled men horrible watch transformation screen see these characters we got laugh first part seeing them play death final act sad see we also get see act patriotism when survivors join ragged rendition god bless america very end,10
The Deer Hunter,movie has very strong cast although only star time robert de niro de niro instantly became films leader he played michael very well he became bona fide star after his work godfather part two he put stardom work here christopher walken had some strongest scenes movie because his involvement deadly game russian roulette meryl streep one greatest actresses ever grace our screens one her first big roles we end paragraph sad note would last movie john cazale would play because he suffering terminal cancer he died before film released he very good stan but you can tell movie he really sick,1
X-Men: First Class,matthew vaughn helm xmen first class classy fun time brings best out its strong cast action scenes dialogue pop ferocity breaths life into incredibly engaging storyline,8
X-Men: First Class,there came point about half way through film when i emerged world wonder screen took stock my emotions instant realized yes god i am loving movie,9
X-Men: First Class,i didnt really expect course although certainly i hoped such incredible cast able director helm story bryan singer provenance inclusion some my favorite if lesser known xtypes darwin tempest havok i eager see beloved band merry marvel mutants redeem themselves after massive failures x3 xmen origins wolverine,10
X-Men: First Class,which they do how,8
X-Men: First Class,one thing avid comic fan must do when approaching movie however divorce themselves utterly almost all established fourcolor xmen continuity oh some bears up but large whole new origin story reboot epic proportions yet retcon so cleverly done one offers up such delicious mélange complex relationships sensible motivation all many discrepancies inherent having mystique side good having moira mctaggert cia agent simply do not matter,9
X-Men: First Class,speaking mctaggert rose byrne both comely convincing role almost every other actor perfectly one might almost say forcefully cast mcavoy brings kind laddish charm charles xavier he mixes nicely both decency naïveté michael fassbenders nascent magneto relentlessly even heartbreakingly compelling their chemistry electric theirs one most multifaceted sincere bromances screen has seen good long while,10
X-Men: First Class,younger cast all impress though particular praise must go oscarnominee jennifer lawrence petulant but pitiable ravenmystique academy awards have been good young hot xchicks let us not forget rogue herself anna paquin won piano former child star nicholas hoult also outstanding troubled hank mccoy perhaps most surprising kudos must go teenage dream lucas till who conveys particular antisocial assholehood turbulent alex summers very convincingly indeed,9
X-Men: First Class,biggest letdown movie actingwise january jones emma frost true she appropriately ravishing there can no denying but she lacks zing written character there very little intelligence snark even personality behind her interpretation most intriguing mutants shes just kind stand there look pretty which one playing emma frost something travesty,8
X-Men: First Class,only other weight under which movie really labors fact prequel therefore suffers feeling inevitability besets all such endeavors anakin skywalker has go dark side bilbo baggins has find one ring magneto has turn against humans mystique has join him xavier has end up wheelchair these definite plot developments looming their eventuation bound bit anticlimax,8
X-Men: First Class,yet fun part about xmen first class journey takes us get us there offering up plenty surprises some kickass action sequences mighty fine special effects sly humor killer cameo without doubt best comic book movie year – nay decade – thus far considering how overcrowded list really saying something,10
X-Men: First Class,huh prequel does not any way suck,9
X-Men: First Class,amazing isnt,10
X-Men: First Class,name,1
X-Men: First Class,there plenty big action scenes throughout but its first half film really impresses establishing these characters entire universe done remarkably well remarkably moving manner new spin familiar bad guys magneto mystique does give actions emotions characters new level appreciation helps give them so much more depth pathos both sides fence xaviers vision magnetos contempt advanced brilliance plot both sides understandable relatable viewer can simply sit watch unfold but also emotionally invested journey during second half plot threads move towards resolution action picks up xavier shining example his journey throughout film matches erik,8
X-Men: First Class,first class never undermines audience nor talks down them does all expected delivers great action humor effects strong connection between heroes villains those developing between retro design suave making period piece gives cool unique flavor collaboration between singer vaughn apparently perfect blend vaughn did brilliant job singers vision first two films stayed tact enhanced i have add score had perfect heroic theme but also moving very well done overall impact film leaves you great sensation job well done fast paced yet filled depth spellbinding visual effects gripping finale end they succeeded reestablishing these characters superb interesting manner there more offer more depth appreciate i certainly cant wait sequel inclusion scott jean original trilogy,4
X-Men: First Class,fox can breath easy again because i think its safe say even extreme fanboys will putting down their pitchforks torches smile after seeing amazing film i know fact general audiences going love movie i know some fans can irrational hold their hate because they expect certain things they read their books but i cant seeing anyone being irrational when faced result delivers what first class manages deliver honestly genredefining movie level any comic based film has come before everything movie exceedingly better than what fox delivered their last two efforts franchise going back beginning rehiring guy brought us those films splendid idea acting here superb dialogue rich every character feels absolutely believable no matter what abilities they have display no cartoonish villains cheese sight every side issue presented people who believe they ones who right underlying message tolerance bigotry only add depth film if not genredefining movie than maybe redefines comic book genre restores sense epic adventure grandscale storytelling we saw x2 fact perfectly complements great film probably surpasses,1
X-Men: First Class,film x2 what godfather 2 godfather seriously first class exceptional flashback look links best xmen trilogy past instead deniro playing young vito corleone we get james mcavoy young charles xavier marlon brando patrick stewart made their respective characters popular but both were more fleshed out incredible younger talent im not placing xmen film itself par godfather but both have become legendary their particular genre i am however saying mcavoy has bright future complex talented actor just like young cast godfather 2 legendary young cast first class has many great days projects ahead them,2
X-Men: First Class,love entire cast but michael fassbender delivers best performance amazing presence command screen everyone extraordinary what many expected indeed happens i mean every scene fassbender mcavoy together absolutely sing wont surprise anyone know kevin bacon oliver platt jennifer lawrence superb supporting roles but nicholas hoult did stunning work beast deserves some love well january jones rose byrne hot can but arent just simple eye candy sure story compelling action amazing but performances elevate movie far above common summer flick,1
X-Men: First Class,movie year so far,9
X-Men: First Class,what you need know about movie before you go see 1 michael fassbender james mcavoy superb each one alone would have made movie terrific but together forgetaboutit every step way every scene every emotion these two men own movie watching their bromance treat start finish make no mistake about even when world brink utter destruction what really matters how these two men relate one another when you watch movie you will care 2 everyone cast good kevin bacon has never been better jennifer lawrence wonderful rose byrne january jones arent given much do ray wise michael ironside only have few short lines but across board entire cast delight 3 story tight youve got bad guy plan which he sets about executing abc fashion against him good guys work together their motivations different course but they pretty much want him stopped so they unite thats 4 charles erik fascinating characters they debate viewers can debate endless about them about who right etc you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends but you understand why they ultimately cant even if they themselves these early days dont understand yet have so perfectly captured summer blockbuster movie part what makes treat future classic but aside their relationship each other movie takes time make each them interesting his own right we get see charles teacher instance come understand how he impacts upon lives those he tutors some eriks best moments away charles his comments mystique about her appearance making clear man has more him than shadow his past 4 most supporting characters have very little screen time but thats okay since isnt their story really bunch mystique beast who best served both have terrific character arcs lesser xmen movie might have been highlight film here their stories serve quality background material main event charles erik beyond we just learn enough about everyone know what they can do like them little bit mostly through their banter most obvious character traits once scene where most supporting characters clearly terrified will certainly go long way towards making you care about them rest movie downside shaws two henchmen dont get anything do except use their powers end story we know much about emma frost we did beginning but these exception not rule 5 visually movie treat fx good no surprise but much better actual setscostumes beautiful whether its remote cia lab lapdance club whether its magneto helmet mystiques everyday clothes you always admiring look whats screen 6 there action scenes all during movie but having said movie builds goes first half more storyheavycharacterheavy so when action really starts we care about everyone again works even scant details given their characters when banshee havok example go into battle you invested them certain degree 7 there surprises deaths betrayals cameos namedropping but well being cool all makes perfect sense storyuniverse movies superb rocksolid script two amazing lead performances film basically bromance havent been excited about xmen franchise since x2 xmen united,9

The Blues Brothers,musical comedy action fantasy should not work especially when one considers first snl skittoscreen adventure which history has shown us decidedly mixed bag but one does two best car chases cinematic history bookend film between there showstopping musical numbers raw humor illinois nazis seriously disgruntled exfiancee all makes perfect sense context universe created aykroyd who cowrote landis who directed belushi his barely contained zeal provides battery pack film,10

Eyes Wide Shut,its shame film promoted hot erotic thriller kubrick would not have allowed marketing campaign go forward had he been alive sure theres lot eroticism movie but those who go looking sexual thrills going were sorely disappointed,9
Eyes Wide Shut,events movie triggered protagonists wifes revelation she almost slept another man kicks off range emotions prompts him reevaluate his sexual relationship her subsequently leading trip through his sexual subconscious critical point all too many viewers miss though its so overtly surreal i dont see how one could miss none real its called eyes wide shut reason,8
Eyes Wide Shut,all our protagonists encounters represent manifestations his sexual fantasies fears his fantasies include group sex sex teenager sex prostitute sex without strings his fears include disease homosexuality notice brutal brief encounter gaybashing gang most all discovery discovery his hidden fantasies which might reveal his true nature world discovery he really pretender doesnt really belong not worthy after all latter probably universal his case while has sexual dimensions not purely sexual end he realizes his fantasies just fantasies least some his fears legitimate instead just fantasizing about sex he should actually have sex his wife not rocket science here but plenty people need reminding time time its welltold story,10
Eyes Wide Shut,i fortunate enough first see movie theaters overseas spared atrocity digital editing make things less explicit david lynch did same thing more recently mulholland drive i hope not beginning trend given all explicit gore brutality movies level sexual explicitness triggers censors simply laughable frankly having seen unedited version i didnt think big deal,10
Eyes Wide Shut,one cant dismiss criticisms nudity all female many women were depicted sexual objects but movie quite pointedly trip through fairly conventional mans sexual unconscious necessarily told male point view so none these things should surprise would very interesting see comparable exploration female sexual subconscious accomplished woman director though im not holding my breath hollywood establishment will allow happen soon,10
Eyes Wide Shut,eyes wide shut illsuited summer movie corridor has no explosions no running shouting single gunshot what has long scenes which characters talk one another slowly carefully problem film marketed having whitehot sex scenes plenty gratuitous nudity while has neither there plenty naked flesh dont get me wrong but exactly opposite way ads make appear not movie about being sexy naked its movie about how flesh just another part being human so what all fuss about marketing campaign misleading led disappointment audience i saw movie who were just looking some skin,10
Eyes Wide Shut,tension plot issues film discusses arent telegraphed audience theyre hinted dialog there no neat resolution end life simply goes you may watch whole film think wasnt about anything then think about what youve seen realize has great deal say,9
Eyes Wide Shut,film meditation sexuality how relates marriage death money its fascinating commentary modern life rare movie dares examine sex impassionately any other issue,9
Eyes Wide Shut,directing cinematography alone would worth price admission without social commentary sets integral part movie they breathe glow live kubrick master director he uses long shots dissolves great effect cruise kidman their best supporting cast also strong its kubricks magic work camera holds film together,10
Eyes Wide Shut,all all definitely worth seeing unuptight its possible watch film actually think about hours afterward thats something you wont get wild wild west,10
Eyes Wide Shut,stanley kubrick tempted do eyes wide shut 1970 but christianne his wife felt her marriage could jeopardy so she implored him not do but eyes wide shut came after all last temptation kubrick,10

Eyes Wide Shut,based psychological drama written viennese novelist arthur schnizler eyes wide shut mirror audaciously obsessive its dazzling revelations profound provocative passionate transmitted frame sex fear death we have see wide eyes fully opened,1
Eyes Wide Shut,i managed swallow my expectations before film setting myself judge its own without judging kubrick film no need no need film kubrick film without any doubt all kubrick films absolutely stunning absolutely visually brilliant though i should warn isnt quite visual film most other kubrick works lot film focuses characters human interaction something rather new director course all kubrick trademarks there cold analytical gazes sharp introspection tom cruise seems like jack nicholson shining even malcolm macdowell clockwork orange times rather striking fact considering tom cruise performances were excellent all around even places not expected again typical kubrick he wasnt much people director but he still knew how direct people,1
Eyes Wide Shut,almost every moment film flawless perfect pristine dialog predictable but some solemn holy fateful sort way though words moments matched so essentially nothing else could possibly fit beyond sounds images all fit together beautifully creating almost unblemished whole only part didnt seem right sequence had been digitally altered while alterations were not nearly so obtrusive i had feared not knowing about them one probably wouldnt notice them they do grow bit noticeable redundancy you see lot more backs than youd expect always same places unfortunately these came right middle one most visually amazing pieces film one most amazing pieces cinema whole my opinion very unwelcome distraction,1
Marriage Story,i didnt expect mirror how my ex wife i had go through stages divorce so accurately my son only 2 when we were divorced all ups downs petty fights anger we had each other exhausting but we went through all just fight him who we both love more than anything we said horrible things each other we can never take back but we didnt really mean we both eventually found way make work him protect him ugliness we made through other side have good relationship now work team raise him love support but long road out hell get there movie portrayed way i would never have expected made me cry numerous times thinking how hopeless angry i so long i feel like movie deserves every accolade gets felt genuine painful but hope end its real powerful,10

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,growing up my favorite book easily charlie chocolate factory roald dahls magical tale young boys adventure strange factory spellbinding though i never had problem original willy wonka move gene wilder despite how unfaithful still cute heartwarming movie i doing backflips when i heard tim burton quite possibly my alltime favorite director would helm new version movie,7
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,first foremost johnny depp perfect willy wonka what people dont really pick up first movie wonka intended well crazy he eccentric freaky way he allowed rotten children get what they deserved protected his factory like his child gene wilder portrayed wonka more like fatherlyfigure really just too nice depp pulls out all stops new willy wonka though there times any audience member will get just bit freaked out,9
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,what i loved most about movie how faithful book everything mentioned chocolate palace hair toffee taken directly book i incredibly impressed,3
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,definitely movie everyone especially those us who hold original tale our hearts wonka chocolate bars all,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,yesterday i had pleasure watching charlie chocolate factory wilkinson american movie day oh boy i delight dont expect bleak remake amusing rather psychedelic 1971version every way genuine tim burtonmovie stacked beautiful imagery wacky humor bizarre characters but same time faithful enough spirit novel roald dahl wouldve been proud also features outstanding performances entire cast johnny depp gives us strange almost creepy willy wonka freddie highmore perfect charlie grandparents lovable wacky five other children their parents amusingly irritating last but not least excellent soundtrack mr danny elfman reminiscent both edward scissorhands his early oingo boingodays go see your parents children grandparents movie bufffriends nephews nieces they will equally delighted,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,i have seen charlie chocolate factory last night though i usually dont care very much giving my opinion journey m burton his team made me cross deserves homage especially all criticism rising around film before has been released,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,i have been tim burton fan more than decade now i grew up his films but what i have been through yesterday his really unique i actually never thought he would offer us such film one day fans his first period all lonely desperate characters wont like sure since mars attacks more specifically since big fish burton decided tell things differently his vision world slightly changed every his films now rejected freak comes down world stays world remains frightening weird even thought we call reality but world worth living thats what charlie chocolate factory all about all begins main title sequence may one main weaknesses film sequence very entertaining visually ambitious but they decided go cgi looks like decision they made last minute since film proudly made real sets real oompas loompas real squirrels main title looks inappropriate its not important but its tim burton film we know how much he usually works his main title hopefully danny elfman there crazy mix edward scissorhands spiderman music when title film appears gave me shivers true musical rollercoaster gives hint what his score will sound like through film,3
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,after its just emotions all kinds them laughs many  audience laughed almost every thirty seconds tears joy we all know charlies gonna find ticket but when he does you just cant refrain your heart beat faster mercy way burton depicts social misery buckets family really touching amazement wonka factory its many rooms true wonder one most achieved design burton ever offered us many mores very much like book even though seems simple childish you would like stop second collect those feelings try analyze them but you dont have time just never stops i realize might flaw some people fact burton never has been so generous terms human warmness,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,johnny depp proposes another inventive completely wacky interpretation here i wont compare gene wilder since i dont know first film very well pretty unknown flick here europe those comparisons should stop anyway depp makes wonka tormented unadapted character who doesnt know much about common courtesy doesnt really care anyway he built up his own universe response his authoritarian father hes pretty proud he just doesnt want those weird word he likes  youve all seen tv spots boring parents their despicable children ruin what life based yet so depps wonka actually very moving pathetic his attempts entertain his visitors burton does everything he can make you hate augustus vercua violet mike moment you first see them you get instantly closer wonka when you noticed he feels same addition john augusts vision wonkas past including always perfect cameo christopher lee offers character real depth you didnt expect,3
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,danny elfman also one main attractions film while his score already classic burtonelfman work some interesting experiments main themes splendid songs he wrote oompas loompas just so funny hugh laughs audience some musical choices those songs dont intend stay you months would have been hard theyre based dahls lyrics doesnt allow broadway impulses theyre just offbeat numbers playing many references so many styles oingo boingo fans have buy soundtrack when itll come out itll bring them back 15 years ago,2
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,what can i tell you more mcdowells sets amazing pescuccis work impressive well rousselots beautiful cinematography some oscar nominations should fall here,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,ending without revealing augusts additions really touching fit perfectly burtons new approach even though final shot tempers family theme he developed through film its still burton not disney burton makes you feel good because he feels good what im writing here will ring bell when youll see movie i dont know you but after so many distressed pessimistic films really moved see he found certain peace charlie chocolate factory step forward direction he gave his career big fish he lost his father he became one hes getting older all those questions doubts expressed many important very complex images scenes he imagined film thats why i could call film edward scissorhands his new period those films very different but gave me both some very essential emotions,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,thank you mburton thank you very much,8
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,i know im minority here but i wasnt jumping up down about movie i loved book child loved original film gene wilder its own original contributionsperhaps im biased still i have always admired tim burton johnny depps work had been looking forward new interpretation roald dahls book,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,film indeed more true book than 1971 versionthe squirrel room jungle scene children leaving factory perhaps little wiser wear however character development 1971 version much better than hereyou were actually given opportunity like dislike each character including willy wonka i did think johnny depps portrayal wonka more true book than gene wilderswilly wonka supposed quite childish eccentric however i thought films preoccupation being true book caused overlook what more important which establish intentions each character least 1971 version its pretty clear what each characters intentions areeven if establishing some these intentions requires conspiracy involving slugworth though i havent read book very long time i do not remember any details being given willy wonkas childhoodi thought these were unnecessary distracting waste time energy could have been better spent childrens character development my opinion after all supposed story about children,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,oompa loompas its true they physically portrayed accurately here more so than 1971 version ie very small people not midgets orange skin green hair however though songs they sing here true book they less charismatic than those 1971 film sometimes seem over top also i didnt like they were all clones each otheri think poor choice,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,finally i appalled endingthis ties my previous comments re willy wonkas childhood changed whole idea behind story itself which supposed my perspective people can overcome their hardships have happy prosperous ending long theyre honest selfless generous movie changes whole theme story one emphasizes importance family over any kind material wealth prosperity both perfectly good legitimate themes but my reading book left me impression roald dahl more concerned former theme than latter accordingly then movie did not do book justice most important fundamental way whereas 1971 film able do so despite its shortcomings,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,tim burton kept saying he wanted make version much more faithful source material which leaves me wondering why he didnt,2
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,theres awful unnecessary counterproductive back story showing wonkas childhood which nothing more than excuse burton bring one his horror movie heroes childhood christopher lee while completely killing any sense mystery wonka might otherwise possess,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,i like johnny depp but his wonka had zero warmthand just plain creepy random one minute hes snippy andor oblivious kids next hes paternal offering charlie some nourishing hot chocolate because he looks like he could use because its line book,3
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,wonka book spritely little gentneither gene wilder nor johnny depp really much like him much less so depp but wilders interpretation always has twinkle his eye you know hes little eccentric but hes always control kids version all pretty good but wonka himself yikes give me gene wilders version over creepy johnny depps michael jackson take any day,2
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,oompaloompa musical numbers blew first one chocolate room okay but overall i had hard time understanding most lyrics all just raucous noise come elfman you can do better than,1
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,wonka telling charlie he cant bring his family live him factory insane first all makes wonka look even more like freaky pedophile second all how earth faithful book,2
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,second time recent memory ive heard producerdirector wooing widow beloved childrens book author then she deciding her dead husband would love new bigscreen version his source material,6
Justice League,such good downgrade its unbelievable movie doesnt shelter soul you cant show feelings its ugly there isnt much thought put into its like not part trilogy forced lame jokes casual uninspiring score stereotyped predictable plot cheesy generic writing undeveloped villain inappropriate atmosphere wrong character development i mean how does one go tell me do you bleed theres something definitely bleeding its like joke who wrote garbage i mean why what your motive,2
Justice League,apart garbage writing coloring sucked too whole movie ugly hell after supermans resurrection fight scene completely miss edited why sun rising do you guys wanted make more colorful because superman takes his power sun because garbage coloring vfx cgi looked garbage,6
Justice League,where villain villain shouldnt have wasted like he made pretty good entrance but movie didnt capitalize afterwards we didnt get know him he exile superman died so he has sent earth destroy yeah sure,1
Justice League,fight scenes were big downgrade too although there were some good shots especially where amazons steppenwolf fight most fight scenes were just casual emotionless,1
Justice League,overall movie just another batman robin back then due its darkness they gave batman nipple now due its darkness they gave batman do you really talk fish there something definitely bleeding lines history repeating itself,3
Justice League,they gave 300000000 movie but doesnt look like big movie right wb really did something theyve disposed movies original composers theyve reedited rewrote whole movie theyve brought new guy who doesnt care about characters bother know them writer director make movie look more like disney movie guy they added bunch reshoots which doesnt add too much movie other than garbageness bad cgi mouth version justice league just wrong doesnt add up doesnt lead anywhere every storyline we started every future we were building up gone movie just depressing,4
Justice League,here we justice league dcs greatest superheroes come together save worldand what first scene you ask henry cavills cgid shaved face ohhh dearyupwere quite ride so superman dead batman wonder woman must arrange team gifted individuals stop world destroyer steppenwolf you guessed destroying world sighhhhi kinda just want hug film repeatedly whisper there thereitll all alright apprehensively i went into unmotivated expecting worst superhero film since suicide squad fortunately isnt bad but its not great either films greatest achievement coalition justice league members their interactions mannerisms even their physicality pretty much point aquaman although absolutely useless had physical prowess beastly underwater warrior flash quirky provided several comedic moments cyborg essentially technological logistics manager wonder woman batman were parents who lead their children into battle heck she even refers them children yet all worked so well remember comic book adaptation so humour light hearted nature its source material does show human cgi most part actually executed well far better than thor ragnarok slow motion scenes flash were gorgeous watch snyder typically style over substance which apparent here story so boringly uninspired defines word lazy i cannot dealing another save world situation im also becoming irritated underused bland weak villains who supposed absurdly powerful steppenwolf wasted potential constant use green screen hit miss script rushed third actjust too many flaws im afraid too soon justice league film considering no origins aquaman flash cyborg yet personally i think so,6
Justice League,everyone knows now due unfortunate circumstances zack snyder director his wife deborah snyder producer had leave project personal reasons which enticed studio warner bros bring avengers director joss whedon finish,5
Justice League,ultimately film seems have been almost completely rewritten reshot ive read fair amount people claiming film still around 80 snyders vision i dont think so,2
Justice League,films original composer junkie xl quickly dispatched replaced danny elfman one could argue films score makes up 50 film easily,10
Justice League,danny elfmans score completely flat heartless there isnt shred emotion single note sounds out place consistently uneven little homages past themes seem thrown used completely wrong times,1
Justice League,almost every scene where superman appears he has ridiculously expensive computer generated botch job mouth cover up moustache henry cavill wasnt allowed shave off re shoots due commitments another film,2
Justice League,i can recall there one scene superman where he didnt have cgi mouth,2
Justice League,tone atmosphere snyders style almost completely lifted film something im sure tampered post production,8
Justice League,doesnt have any kind atmosphere all really just feels empty,5
Justice League,actors all fine deliver worthy performances characters its not their fault film which built around them complete disaster,4
Justice League,just goes show studio couldnt care slightest about delivering serious decent production they had release date they forced themselves stick regardless outcome,1
Justice League,most film feels completely rushed cheap which shouldnt given had budget 300 million,6
Justice League,its simply unacceptable something capacity scale epitome mindless product bloodsucking power driven cooperation,5
Justice League,would have been such loss put project hold until zack deborah snyder returned delay film until everything good could possibly apparently yes,7
Justice League,theres been absolutely no respect source material vision original director target audience warner bros,8
Justice League,zack snyders complete version im sure has its faults flaws but nothing can compare lacklustre effort,1
Justice League,should have been best superhero film ever made but has been dropped fallen straight bottom barrel,5
Justice League,i could go but ill stop there,3
Tesla,beautifully shot appealing cast does work have film break 4th wall when anne morgan speaks camera story carries us along director cast win more than they lose where gets rough movie struggles end just who he when hes older what would older nikola tesla have said younger telsa about science business women thats question often used interviews what would you say your younger self wanted more than song sung also perhaps insight romance aspect could have used more,8
Contagion,sometimes i think people just simply watch movies wrong looking through some negative reviews steven soderberghs contagion one those moments its procedural movie meant capture wideranging reality massive disease outbreak modern era not three act drama character arcs its simply different type movie than lot people used so they dont know how process anyway,10
Contagion,one many things i love about film starts day 2 not day 1 we dont see actual origin outbreak until very end film when jumps back time so we spend majority film trying navigate confusion outbreak we want know source but we know little who cdc officials trying track alongside tracking though human cost disease,9
Contagion,thats mostly handled through matt damons character who watches his wife stepson die some very first victims disease though he seems immune i expected film follow convention damon would key cure but simply never brings up idea hes just left tend his daughter they navigate breakdown law order,9
Contagion,disease spreads quickly though no one disease prevention industry can get grasp they first have trouble limiting all efforts which prove futile then they have trouble replicating lab setting which only gets fixed nongovernment doctor ignores orders destroy his samples continues his work they then have trouble figuring out how actually attack until one chief scientists circumvents procedure injects herself most promising vaccine theyve developed up point then storys still not over because while they do have vaccine they also have millions millions people who need they can only make so much time so lottery gets developed distribute out birthdate,8
Contagion,another way movie captures messy reality situation how uses its characters press there two journalist san francisco paper blogger journalist completely uninterested first steps disease they unfold because its just not corroborated big enough blogger though antivaccine advocate jumps story feed his own biases journalist too slow blogger ends up using his position perceived prophet profit off hysteria pushing bunk cure,10
Contagion,use major movie stars seemingly small roles very smart decision well one its biggest stars gwyneth paltrow dies first twenty minutes another major stars dies within hour movie uses star power intelligently telling audience disease can take out anyone increases tension helping cloud resolution,8
Contagion,its movie about ever changing process get unseen threat thats debilitating world order under control its not about characters going through big emotional changes catharsis them end film its thriller global scale what sets out do does extremely well i think its one most effective thrillers decades,9
Contagion,i knew important movie when came out i had not seen anything like before excellent writing good direction invisible antagonist most importantly sense realism,7
Contagion,nine years later coronavirus disease running rampant my mind keeps going back horror depicted movie i tried hold back but my eyes welled up tears should mustsee movie younger generation since captures frightening reality pandemic humankinds reaction like no movie has ever captured before,7
Contagion,moment 2020 i know many more will die coronavirus scary thought what makes even more scary me my wife physician she reminds me kate winslets character she out there fighting infection fear comes like her she tireless compassionate no movie documentary can ever capture portray fear follows bravery like dark shadow nevertheless i applaud audacity filmmakers making such important movie important movie i sincerely hope no one ever has make movie like future,7
Contagion,cerebral movie many complain about having too many characters but these characters serve illustration main character pandemic explored non sensationalistic but still interesting compelling way most scary thing about movie its realism yes what really would happen if there were pandemic not everyone would die there would no flashy helicopter drama but would not pleasant experience either good movie but perhaps not seekers cheap thrills,7
Contagion,deep dive into eventually pandemic we get story main point veiw several characters few side storys seem unnecessary but most part all fits together like jigsaw film fast paced times can hard follow however show cases its themes well will keep you interested until very end film doest really end you just step into 2020,8
Contagion,2011 idea seemed very far fetched jargons uses wasnt really connected audience but but experiencing horror corona virus researching lot about movie makes lot sense its far more connected its actually visionary moviejust released ahead time because most us wouldnt have experienced,8
Contagion,if theyd only called coronavirus not contagion decent film watch if youre not anxious,9
Contagion,not zombie movie not overdramatized race catch carrier before infects everyone rather realistic depiction fast spreading contagion high mortality rate i am watching spread covid19 i see numerous parallels film ok virus movie way too deadly short incubation period but made more easy contain vaccine developed incredibly fast too i mean had all fit inside less than two hours other words describing exactly what happening now but much faster rate therefore important note predictions film idiots spreading rumors online violence desperate people supply shortages every level,9
Contagion,i loved how contagion did not exaggerate almost anything there no huge number deaths relative worlds population there no dramatic save heroes no karmic retribution against obvious villains even bad things they happen they show animal nature humankind its basest but world doesnt end civilisation doesnt collapse its easy imagine 5 years after vaccine everybody has conveniently forgot how they stepped their neighbors steal their stuff instead they commemorate innocent victims,8
Contagion,i am still waiting epic movie tv series about 1918 epidemic oh you didnt know about you know very little how convenient amnesia isnt,8
Contagion,okay theres bound lot similarities film novel coronavirus outbreak thats now reaching around globe rapid speed course contagion being hollywood film virus spread much faster than real thing well caused way more fatalities writing 2212020 there 77767 cases 2360 deaths 20833 recovered around world thats pretty fast virus just recognized 12312019 not even two months ago some ideas behaviors contagion seemed far fetched but end wasnt really bad production consideration nature virus infections tend mysterious unknown first place,8
Contagion,not much say hasnt been already critics right effective slick movie may bit slight far character development but doesnt suffer too badly movie far more about ideas than people not necessarily bad thing,8
Contagion,excellent direction soderbergh masterful cinematography while there few logical missteps writing more than makes up confounding expectations more than once truly creative credible ways,7
Batman Begins,tell truth i thought batman franchise could never saved i really let down i may never see my favorite superhero good movie ever again then i saw preview batman begins i didnt really know what think new batman new alfred new story new style i wasnt sure why i wanted old way but maybe i wanted actors batman films i grew up revive themselves make good batman movie i wanted robin sadly batgirl alongside batman saving world another familiar villain,10
Batman Begins,i heard batman begins i thought great called batman 1989 selfishly i said i want something new,10
Batman Begins,but course being big batman fan i went opening night begings 2 half hours later like rest audience completely blown away only movie i had ever been yes i have been some great ones where crowd claps end not just golf claps popcorn clip standing ovation 1030 pm show crowded theater austin texas,9
Batman Begins,i never would have thought would have worked even nolan directing but i wrong so wrong after seeing xmens spidermans i clearly thought marvel had upperhand dc just simply trying keep up again so wrong,10
Batman Begins,nolan gave us dark gritty pleasantly realistic view batman bale gives tremendous performance both batman bruce wayne michael caine fabulous alfred morgan freeman almost stole show luscious fox,10
Batman Begins,even though xmen spidermanall them wonderful superhero movies batman begins just good no great movie i think what blew people away wasnt just some superhero special effect hero gets girl good guy wins movie truly dark well crafted movie maybe stupid say but didnt even feel like you were watching superhero movie,8
Batman Begins,i dont even think burton his animated stylewhich works could have revived troubled series schumaker wrecked because like fantastic four daredevil tried over do give us latter part things,10
Batman Begins,so here you chris nolan you saved franchise you made unforgettable movie will remembered best superhero movie all time but just all around great unforgettable movie classic,8
Batman Begins,sickened me past see batman movie franchise slowly digging its way early grave after quality tim burton films series pretty much went down toilet beginning horrifically campy age bat creditcards armored arnold schwarzenegger tossing cringeworthy puns batman who seemed trying not embarrassed fact his costume had nipples so what could warner brothers producers hope do resurrect franchise pretend never happened start whole series over again talented director compelling story capable cast,10
Batman Begins,enter christopher nolan mastermind behind 2000s momento widely praised one most innovative films decade directorco screenwriter nolan creates richly dark atmospheric world batman inhabit similar burton films but less cartoony films screenplay written nolan david s goyer quality stuff its true some dialog exchanges can seem kind contrived particularly between wayne liam neesons character ducard but sounds so classy you tend not care,8
Batman Begins,nolan also puts lot trust his audiences stay put while first hour film comprehensively explores bruce waynes backstory no cape donning few fight sequences nevertheless pace never slows story so unexpected fascinating who would have expected batman film begin prison tibet only nolan could pull off theres little chance us losing interest way we really get sense who bruce wayne trait none past movies were able capture including burton films we see what drives him what leads him become iconic crime fighter reasoning behind mask,8
Batman Begins,course help audience get under bruce waynes skin doesnt hurt have such talented lead christian bale bale has been emerging one most talented actors his generation he brings talent peak here playing darkest all superheroes if you were break down role batmanbruce wayne you would find essentially three characters wayne batman behind mask waynes public facade billionaire playboy real brooding bruce wayne bale plays all three characters absolute perfection molds them together well enough make clear show they still same person he has been given tons accolades his performance already needless say he deserves every one,10
Batman Begins,sheer quality supporting cast mindboggling if number big names only its very hard find weak spot incredibly strong array performances here but if one had found would have katie holmes its not she gives bad performance contrary but just she seems too young convincing district attorney me michael gough will always definitive alfred but michael caine does excellent job taking over role giving very strong often funny performance liam neeson sheer class ducard waynes mysterious mentor morgan freeman lucius fox waynes arms manufacturer provider batman gear its wonderful see incredibly talented much underrated gary oldman sgt gordon only decent cop gotham he truly makes role his own even cult favorite rutger hauer makes appearance richard earle ambitious head wayne enterprises surprise surprise villains also actually menacing once opposed cartoony corny cillian murphy just about walks away show truly chilling scarecrow sequences involving his fear gas surprisingly frightening ken watanabe mysterious creepy guild leader ras al ghul tom wilkinson very convincing carmine falcone head gotham city mob,10
Batman Begins,nolans knack realism also comes breath fresh air age cgi bloated blockbusters there next no computer generated shots movie even sequence batman standing top high building staring down city filmed stuntman really works batmobile actually interacts its environment looks so much better real than computer generated but dont think film will come across too serious stuffy because nolans realism true gotham seems too dark dirty come across fantasy world but batman begins retains unmistakable sense fun seems only present comic book movies we jeer fear villains cheer hero he lays his life line vanquish evil save city how should theres even surprising twist near end which doubly surprising because actually comes shock whats not love here,10
Batman Begins,further cudos director nolan finally managing make swarm bats actually frightening once,10
Batman Begins,overall id have label batman begins must see movie summer its well written authoritatively directed impeccably acted especially bales powerhouse lead performance cillian murphys sickly menacing scarecrow very high quality production indeed most other summer blockbusters could learn thing two batman begins if batman franchise died under its own gaudiness years ago let us rejoice glorious rebirth batman truly does begin here,10
Batman Begins,1,10
Batman Begins,start off review id like go back original batman series adam west hammed up what has campest yet enjoyable version batman cheesy had pow whack kaboom very very tongueincheek which brings me my next point what batman eventually became batman featuring michael keaton good film keaton good batman he portrayed dark knight whole new army fans darker batman less camp plus villain such jack nicholson turning another great performance joker win win where there sequel keaton yet again batman returns not good its predecessor but still thoroughly enjoyable film villains being penguin devito catwoman pfeiffer adding something different batman series all going well then things start go sour keaton gone comes kilmer who has most wooden batman ever come clichés tongue cheek oneliners so but batman still has some credibility until dare i mention batman robin ruined batman series clooney just being eyecandy ladies addition batgirl oh dear lord villains just coming out most tongueincheek one liners ever example mr freeze youre not sending me cooler wrong oh so wrong something had done batman begins film rescues batman series singlehandedly its shame didnt start off way might not died its rear bale inspired choice batman bringing more serious side batman story well paced its not all talk just mindnumbing action actually keeps you gripped you want find more about bruce waynes past only reason misses out 10 quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow if youve not seen i dont want give too much away about story but throw away all your perceptions about batman because batman back batman has truly begun dman,10
Batman Begins,christopher nolan cast have pulled off what i hadnt dared dream batman every bit good burtonkeatons vision eradicated camp feverish memories clooney kilmer cough odonnell,10
Batman Begins,story good origin story youll find covering all major truetothecomic events not wasting ages them we see waynes allimportant training period previously ignored his connection tibetan shadowninja clan led ras al ghul we see bruce come up ideas his symbol his costume his gadgets his car his cave all fits so perfectly,10
Batman Begins,thats not all liam neeson perfect ever when lucas isnt writing his lines batmans first mad nemesis scarecrow genuinely frightening some outstandingly scary fear effects gary oldman looks just like young commissioner gordon doesnt dominate morgan freeman rutger hauer give solid heavyweight support boardroom machinations wayne enterprizes i love michael gough but michael caine great alfred its only katie holmes who didnt ring true me not because her performance but simply because she looks all 15 years old sorry katie i am always blown away christian bale no exception,10
Batman Begins,fights great batgadgets all there car amazing plot thorough exciting gotham looks great batman really frightening menacing lethal scenes bats themselves finally get across idea how scary they can,9
Batman Begins,there some humour but its fairly dry soundtrack like all best original soundtracks excellent you hardly know its there but emotions scene enhanced boosted most part serious batman film plenty longtime fans new batman one id like see again bravo mr nolan bravo,10
Batman Begins,i had fearful reservations about one i loved tim burtons batman 12 years old when came out i perfect age i also enjoyed batman returns franchise went so wrong under joel schumacher i wasnt sure i wanted resurrected not least because batman one few comics i read enjoyed kid always my favourite superhero i grew up reading comics watching reruns adam west tv show then getting burtons celluloid vision i spoilt choice kid but adult now i concerned revisiting franchise especially given warners record over last decade screwing up summer blockbusters potential all over place dare i bring up matrix sequels,10
The Lorax,case changes bookoriginal tv short lot people have been lamenting frame story movie adds well idea making onceler human character far frame goes its done pretty well its bit flat but perfectly enjoyable younger kids making onceler human though brilliant hear me out original onceler faceless force destruction shadowy embodiment greed onceler just stupid kid dream guy who wants change world hes not evil but he lets his success get his head brings about his own downfall destruction forest thats fantastic heres why thats how world really companies dont sit around all day cackling about how much smog theyre pumping into atmosphere its process something happened gradually obliviousness just dangerous maliciousness thats really powerful lesson can happen you if youre not careful anybody can hurt planet if they dont pay attention thats rare lesson one im really pleased see movie,8
The Lorax,so silly stupid sometimes yes course but its colorful exuberant lot ways i think really captured seussness similar remakes have missed theres nothing offensive about besides miserable marketing my little brother enjoyed fun movie i enjoyed giving us deeperand my opinion very powerfulcharacter type accidental villain everydude who makes horrible mistake environment suffers so take you willbut overall i found myself liking lot more than i expected definitely worth watch,5
The Lorax,i went see movie two girl friends mine throughout movie one them kept groaning sighing same parts i did other later accused us never having been kids i think they might both right,6
The Lorax,if you were ever child you probably familiar doctor seusss lorax tale world where mans greed selfishness has eradicated all trees favor their escapist manmade town its charming yet somewhat depressing book main character realizes what hes destroyed yet leaves glimmer hope end he passes off last tree seed young boy plant kid i loved bittersweet end got message across made me want care about preserving nature,9
The Lorax,movie other hand left me thoroughly unimpressed let me get good parts out way first naturally art style fantastic whimsical all seuss work danny devito does great job lorax i feel its pretty safe say parts story actually focusing lorax himself were indeed enjoyable exception badly placed musical number which makes any sorrow trees being destroyed seem diluted you should upset lorax leaves us but i more upset i wasnt upset,6
The Lorax,unfortunately part story focusing boy trying find tree tiresome its case where book more dramatic than story nature had been ravaged nobody cared about except one boy movie its basically all because some horribly stereotyped evil characters onceler himself painted naive but still good person but creators apparently didnt want him seem corrupt chopping down all trees so they have his redneck family do him business tycoon mr ohare just ridiculously evil im not going say big businessmen shouldnt villains anything like but point original book all mankind had stopped caring whereas movie says its fault onceler ohare entirely latter who deliberately keeping people clueless about trees i just feel ending would have been far more dramatically appropriate if instead having clichéd underwhelming chase scene where he shows everybody ohare evil if he instead needed actually convince people trees were worth caring about he convinces them knocking down wall end apparently last 15 so years nobody had even once looked outside additionally when he finally plants seed all other trees start growing again not sure how but makes me wonder if thats all took why didnt onceler try plant seed 15 years ago,9
The Lorax,also they throw hip grandmother pretty much entirely because they know grandparents will taking their kid one point romantic interest actually says wow how cool your grandmother bothered me some reason perhaps because i have no soul,3
The Lorax,also its apparently musical something ads failed mention im not against musicals but combined fact 1 i wasnt prepared despicable me their previous movie had none 2 music bland i cant remember any i just got out 20 minutes ago also i said earlier one musical number completely ruins tragic mood tried set trees getting chopped down,1
The Lorax,i know can hard translating seuss book usually only 20 30 pages into feature film tough task but honestly if you dont even get theme right then you have failed your task lorax enjoyable lot parts but parts arent arent,2
The Lorax,final verdict 510 your kids might like but uninspired music botched ending boring finale real game breakers,9
The Lorax,all reviewers movie seem either love hate its easy see why,2
The Lorax,has been pointed out death modernized hollywood story added celebrityvoiced kid trying win girl overcome two dimensional villain process thoroughly uninteresting will make older moviegoers angry lack effort made expanding story,8
The Lorax,oncelers tale other hand story carried over book one unchecked ambition carelessness onceler morally gray done very well he likable yet youre never sure he villain misguided hero somewhere between sure its padded out cutesy animals but knowing what becomes them end makes considerably less innocent story where seusss message still makes through,10
The Lorax,score john powell epic animation designs gorgeous which add great atmosphere darker parts movie environmental message very unsubtle people who dislike other movies will dislike here,1
The Lorax,one need only listen cut song biggering see how powerful story could have gotten they just didnt have guts but beauty does manage seep through places one movie id highly recommend seeing only parts,9
The Lorax,i so happy movie i knew i had see but i hesitant most reviewers have said one dr suesss best books how can possibly translate properly movie,10
The Lorax,well hesitant i watch lorax i curious i watched my 2 12 year old daughter i loved whats more my daughter loved which more important than what i think anyway everyday since we got dvd my daughter pulls off shelf says mommy lets watch lorax but most parents know already your kids have their favorites my daughter wont sit through movies she doesnt like seems become one those favorites,7
The Lorax,also make clear my daughter familiar book well she has me read almost every night both book movie drive same message across slightly different but effective ways,1
The Lorax,i loved thought excellent artistic interpretation wonderfully written lorax dr suess i only hope after all books turned movies recently people can start understand book movie separate but never seems understoodthere will always discrepancies between book movie main thing movie wonderful despite differences,4
The Lorax,its hard hollywood make adaptation book dr seuss especially if its something like lorax lorax one dr seuss darkest tales serious sentiment film adaptation keeps story but focuses too much its fun characters gimmickry 3d than environmental message leaves message background film whole its colorful fun but feels very different,8
The Lorax,film adds lot new things stretch small story like onceler reveals his face kid beginning has different motive why he went onceler its strange clever creators despicable me studios trademark add some cute comic relief characters humming fish swomee swans barbaloots cute enough,7
The Lorax,its easy say danny devito perfect lorax ed helms bit charming onceler everything film fun songs pretty good although its not quite memorable what disappoints here execution story yes message there but feels like its just background film more goes fun theres nothing wrong but its too light dark story,10
The Lorax,film has heart soul show dr seuss illustration but storytelling feels too different message there but its not compelling book its pretty hard say its bad film because its entertaining fun its hard say its great because lacks eagerness message seems like horton hears who will remain best dr seuss adaptation so far,3
The Lorax,one problems recent attempts adapt dr seuss books into movies hollywoods tendency intrude upon his work cute snappy dialogue slapstick comedy expand appropriately thin material gobs hipcool dialogue needless subplots anyone familiar dr seuss books knows completely wrong approach good example lorax 1971 book which about depletion environment through industrial carelessness book ends somber but hopeful message environment could saved one caring individual movie ends car chase you can see problem here,2

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,ive never seen series like trilogy movies created such love care utter perfection craft you cant help but walk away wonder how did peter jackson make possible i have always loved original star wars indiana jones series their epic storytelling just just fitting great moment cinema should will remembered much revered fondness generations come they do not make films like these anymore,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,stand alone film picks up immediately where two towers ends so brush up before seeing ive read books anticipation seeing some more profound moments film made me kind view rushed sense perspective i wanted make sure everything film done right when happened i will need see again enjoy everything more casual level,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,cast comes through once more musical score retains its beauty elegance power special effects notably gollum again nothing less than breathtaking simply move story along battles monumentally huge exciting there some liberties taken story especially during end homecoming yet everything needed covered regarding main characters handled after greatest moment series resolves itself story provided breather gives goodbye friends seen screen last three years truly bittersweet feeling realizing there will no rings movie 2004 i will miss talented group actors,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,first two film very long but goes without you ever truly realizing film so much more than simple fantasy epic its story about strength character friendship loyalty love while every member fellowship has their part play i finally understood why some critics have said series story about sam its his unwavering resolve led quest its victory sean astin true credit adding inspirational heart epic far ending goes they ended way had ended jackson ended film way should have been,9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,i will miss looking forward new rings movie but these movies provide hope highquality films can still made without special effects taking over story bathroom humor top 40 soundtrack george lucas could learn lot these films about how not alienate fanbase,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,each film has earned 10 me last two years which me give rarity one however equally deserving its two predecessors academy had better not look over film best picture 2003 do so would greatly disrespectful craft care anyone involved these films put into them,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,obviously im aware fact lord rings trilogy actually one giant movie but since released parts thats how im judging them return king final chapter since climax resolution epic journey has little more intensity urgency than previous installments,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,point everyone has come know love all characters stakes have become tremendously high kingdoms their knees only two characters who can save day getting weaker weaker tension very high episode i can honestly say out all 3 only one had me edge my seat there were many memorable scenes one my favourites including part giant spiderthat made classic sure stay decades come,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,longest series mostly because ending seems last while good ending i can see why frodo did what he did he us audience have gone through incredible ordeal i think we needed 20 minute linger when battle over celebrations have ended there sad emptiness felt films spanned over 3 years there have been extended cuts course but after its all over peter jackson gave us ending both appropriate admirable,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,these were some amazing movies one particular best my opinion whole lord rings phenomenon absolute phenomenon much more than just movies they have universal appeal have touched hearts imaginations millions im one them,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,sorry if im being all fanboyish kissing movies ass but i really admire may not among my personal favourites but generally seems movie event century there will never another lord rings film thats bit depressing,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,my rating 1010,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,wonderful every level love characters special effects one biggest most massive battle scenes ever put silver screen great end monumental epic,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,saying film starts where two towers left off somewhat misleading film starts great distance walls helms deep return king opens flashback smeagol andy serkis obtaining one ring power origin his deterioration into creature gollum opening recaptures emphasis somewhat lost within epic battles two towers thats ring first installment fellowship ring provided heaps exposition rings importance influence return king we see pay off big time,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,after armies isengard have been defeated due allegiance between theoden bernard hill king rohan elves main threat middle earth now concentrated kingdom mordor controlled dark lord sauron sauron has turned his eye towards realm gondor last free kingdom men wizard gandalf ian mckellan must warn denethor john noble steward gondor impending attack while aragorn viggo mortenson heir throne gondor theoden gather men aid against armies mordor dark lord sauron needs only regain one ring power conquer all middle earth two hobbits frodo elijah wood ringbearer sam sean astin must continue their journey directed gollum mount doom only place where ring can destroyed got all if not you need bone up your lord rings before expecting follow film,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,since all three epics were filmed simultaneously each individually has feel being part larger picture except one return king just too big most epic set epic films now director peter jackson has brilliantly constructed characters plotlines throughout first two films he puts them use,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,all characters have their best moments within film pair mischievous hobbits merry dominic monaghan pippin billy boyd no longer tree ornaments they were two towers but splitup take their characters completely new directions aragorn played unmatched sense honor viggo mortenson about meet his destiny future king all men while andy serkis continues his expert portrayal gollum serkis provided not only voice gollum but also assisted during production acting out scenes computergenerated character his fellow actors,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,however real acting triumph film elijah wood frodo baggins he continues his descent into corruption incredible talent many could not pull off woods performance so critical film because determines rings power corrupt which needless say absolute,10

Dolittle,quest also intended emotional closure dolittle whom we told animated prologue had secluded himself behind high walls dolittle manor following death his wife lily kasia smutniak seven years ago not only does dolittle have come out hiding mission also requires him retread lilys fateful voyage before she lost storm out sea also gets personal dolittle other ways including having come face face rassoulim antonio banderas ferocious tiger barry ralph fiennes,10
Dolittle,not much matters hands director cowriter gaghan dolittle little more than series frantic setpieces under guise swashbuckling adventure freneticism also result whole menagerie animals which dolittle brings along his voyage including insecure gorilla rami malek bouncy polar bear john cena quarrelsome duck octavia spencer wise macaw emma thompson constantly fighting attention screaming over each other order heard,3
Dolittle,each scene messy you can imagine little point except create enough distraction keep younger ones among audience entertained nonstop bickering worse these nonhuman characters seem all over scene same time often either eclipsing dolittle making him seem utterly inconsequential doesnt help there little depth each one nonhuman characters even whole bunch hollywood alisters assembled give them voice especially since they simply given one single defining trait nothing more,6
Dune,dune odd film after having watched several times over years im not afraid call very flawed classic sounds strange but fits movie lynch got so many things right but end shortcomings trying squeeze epic story into little over 2 hours simply too daunting challenge besides im sure many went into theatre expecting film vein star wars,9
Dune,dune not story which one can delve into brainless does require thought its inaccurate portray anything less than thinking persons story its not space battles lasergun shootouts funny aliens etc theres nothing wrong those things its just not what dune about touches everything politics religion ecology true power human mind will when fully realized god etc some heady stuff,8
Dune,so imagine trying fit all movie,8
Dune,lynch got feel imagery down but wasnt able cohesively bring story around wo really making cliff notes version story you get main gist but dont get full story themes etc so end does disappoint because youre left wondering what may have been had movie conventions time allowed 2 even 3 movie epic oh wait star wars did i guess dune wasnt viewed bankable enough make such investment,5
Dune,anyway i still like film lot visual realization lynch makes classic my book too bad couldnt matched equally strong script i wonder if peter jackson would willing tackle another 3 film epic hmmmmmm,7
Dune,first all ive read herberts dune saga i loved first book one movie about liked rest,10
Dune,second there difference between cinema version 137 min tv version 190 min often referred also special edition which should also not confused new version 2000 frank herberts dune keep short 137 version great 190 min version sucks,10
Dune,tv version split up fill 2 evenings they added about hour additional material not seen original version while some quite good like prologue which went little bit deeper into dune universe butlers djihad but most just destroys atmosphere flow movie technical side there note whole movie panscanned which never good idea compared original version quality really blows,8
Dune,now good one,1
Dune,movie pretty much faithful book there things were cut out book shows stuff wasnt there but what you see clearly herberts book which i thought nearly impossible translate into good movie translates feel book very well screen,7
Dune,most notable differences book paul age 15 least beginning while mclachlan more looks like 20 but i can live rest minor things like these sound modules some differences continuity navigators needing spice well navigate revealed beginning,10
Dune,all actors give solid performances notable kenneth mcmillan baron harkonnen patrick captain picard steward gurney halleck sting feyd rautha which really add movie,1
Dune,special effects range crappy good movie shines where s most important namely sand worms which look fairly convincing personally i prefer well done miniature shots over those episode 12 cgi effects which make especially environments look like plastic,6
Dune,i think everybody who calls himself sciencefiction fan should have seen movie which jewel under all those mediocre films were spawned star wars time all fans book should see what movie based dune if you want book word word dont watch movie read book again,1
Dune,begin i have say i saw movie first read book years later seems important nearly everybody who read book first hates movie but most those who saw movie first seem like,5
Dune,now why so i cannot really understand because comparition other movies based existing literature what we have here film which stays very close original story does not add many new elements,1
Dune,when i read book i could see movie front me nearly every chapter so i really dont understand what herbertfans had expected movie,1
Dune,i my part like lot has very mystical atmosphere about story develops nicely course there some elements which simply not explained therefore very confusing but somehow seems thing lynch tends do every his movies so what i like some simple scenes like opening monologue whole lot i love music which played my mind all time while i read book i think characters very strong example letho atreides sometimes full tragedy,10
Dune,part i like most though wormpart i think special effects not always brilliant but seeing scenes worms i am really awestruck because they so impressing,1
Dune,all all i think one more underrated movies science fiction history may because director himself not happy because fans expected too much simple two hour movie i always enjoy watching film listening soundtrack i would love see directors cut version,1
Maleficent,movie brilliant ans deserves way higher rating than has whole character maleficent so intresting twist original story really good,10
Maleficent,ignore trailer go see,9
Maleficent,i saw movie tonight friend spectacular going i excited lifelong disney fan but also expecting somewhat cheesy goodvsevil type movie based what i had seen trailer i couldnt have been more wrong angelina jolie delivers amazing performance makes wellknown previously rather one dimensional disney villain relateable more sympathetic while also managing look like convincing gorgeous magical creature,10
Maleficent,cgi tad heavy little freaky times such three coloured pixiesaunts but used combination some amazing sets create fantastic world creatures which were reminiscent beautiful imaginative work movies such hellboy 2 pans labyrinth effort art team here really helps draw you into maleficents world beginning movie makes you wish you were kid growing up movie fodder your imagination,10
Maleficent,although maleficents character has been humanised retelling story really emphasises she isnt human all explores ins outs her life how she relates humans she encounters,7
Maleficent,plot movie really fits into current trend exploring antihero breaking bad hannibal shows disney trying break its past depiction characters being black white good evil etc,4
Maleficent,i feel like i am gushing over film but disney classic lover i have been truly impressed what sure new favourite kids adults equally i do expect some controversy over parts film but i wont discuss those here,10
Maleficent,film true fairy tale its dark its raw its written dark raw experience women,1
Maleficent,maleficent about what happens when your prince turns into frog its personal inner journey recover physical trauma emotional betrayal those who closest us who we trust most its about how survive type horrific evil without becoming evil yourself its message profound,10
Maleficent,critics complaining about film want fairy tales stay same onelovefitsall mode where people either good evil all one needs find romantic love marry good prince princess you will live happily ever after safe any pain sorrow but real life lot messier than,9
Maleficent,its actually evidence how rare see womens unfiltered subjective emotional landscape portrayed film seems many critics cannot even wrap their brains around,2
Maleficent,no matter film so sensually visually stunning viscerally emotionally cathartic sheer word mouth enthusiasm going make blockbuster no matter what critics say,1
Maleficent,its equally rare see protagonist whose inner landscape more complex than simply extracting revenge destroying their enemies androll credits people more complicated than fairy tale we sold every other action adventure film only serves reinforce psychopathic values revenge bravado,1
Maleficent,sometimes film so ahead its time critics behind so philosophically deep its message incomprehensible more superficial among us one such film,10
Maleficent,woolverton jolie have crafted masterpiece,1
Maleficent,dont miss,3
Maleficent,every true fan original sleeping beauty 1959 skeptical about how much had deviate actual movie more movie revealed only proving another female empowerment victimized villain kind movie but im glad i wrong im sure only watching whole movie can we truly appreciate understand very convincing back story development character subject course very liberal changes original plot key elements youd look intact need i mention perfect casting angelina jolie maleficent truly comes life full form angelinas stunning skills presence twist thats not cliché sentiments deep humor thats ever so natural action always keeps you edge your seat maleficent movie not exactly we know her few minutes we got see her original movie but let me tell you shes every bit deliciously evil amusing see angelina play role requires lot nuances pull character lot depth opposed onedimensional character movie never letting off grip she carried movie her shoulders nothing take away beauty rest movie which takes breath excellent direction visual effects will truly transport you another world amazing work all supporting actors yes other characters werent fleshed out maleficent but i see good thing given title theme spectacular balance id also like bring light enchanting score thanks james newton howard maestro underrated,2
Maleficent,comprehensive movie theres little something audiences all ages truly masterpiece,10
Maleficent,review i really thought going typical disney movie about fairies magic dust but i really enjoyed although storyline based around sleeping beauty i found quite dark some adult content cgi throughout movie looked impressive angelina jolie played her part extremely well after being betrayed her loved one she turns quite evil full hate but once aurora comes into picture you get see inner sweetness which made her character entertaining joy watch pieced together sharlto copley playing villain movie really did have every aspect covered im not surprised made so much money box office great watch,2
Maleficent,roundup angelina jolie really doesnt make many movies anymore but when she comes out woodwork she really does come out some good movies changeling action packed wanted she really does have versatile acting ethic all her charitable work her hectic family life im not surprised making movies low down her priority list i liked chemistry between her character sam riley who played crow action scenes were very well thought out director personally i dont think its movie young ones because there some scenes will give them nightmares but there some scenes they will enjoy like her magical land amazing creatures all im surprised i enjoyed movie because i really wasnt expecting something so dark,1
Maleficent,budget 180million worldwide gross 757million wow,3
Maleficent,i recommend movie people who into there disney movies which based concept cinderella 710,1
Maleficent,release movie adaptations classics like snow white jack beanstalk both which i highly entertained thought simply amazing movie sad let down,3
Maleficent,pros visually stunning angelina jolies performance spot most evil classical villains we always knew,2
Maleficent,cons most beautiful princess aurora looks like girl next door why does hollywood try do beyond me mary jane watson spidermans love interest supposed beautiful actress model but again movie portrays girl next door look ultimate spiderman elle fannigs acting not strong end not memorable least felt like she there sake being there,4
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,poor plotting inconsistent pacing rushed sense chemistry amongst new cast pirates caribbean dead men tell no tales exposes swashbuckling sequel nothing more than cashgrab thats hollow ships they occupy,6
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,after not really caring last pirates caribbean film i didnt have high expectations movie but i went saw i right have these low expectations premise film sees return captain jack sparrow he leads expedition trident poseidon while run old enemy johnny depp has become known role jack sparrow i think when character he usually delivers his best until film he has some charisma jack nuances his performances makes him entertaining but character shell his former self least funny he has ever been least charming he has been i ended up feeling like he phoned performance quite bit supporting cast pretty large but i will go over main ones salazar played javier bardem main villain film i thought he pretty decent villain he little hard understand times but he pretty menacing film i liked his back story makes him also little sympathetic but then he menacing adds his performance geoffrey rush back hector barbosa film like always he great i wasnt biggest fan some things done his character but rush always gives fun charismatic performance does make me smile however we get new characters played brendon thwaites kaya scodelario who both completely wooden lacking i didnt buy there chemistry all i didnt like involvement lore try make them interesting because they really werent story very jumbled bit all over place similar stranger tides there just too many people going after artifact you dont even remember them all salazar plot trident plot feels like two different movies meshing just really didnt work script has couple laughs i cant deny i laughed enough passable however there lot misses script possibly being least funny films definitely film least drama heart style film has some pirates action scenes very enjoyable especially towards beginning film but film progresses action felt bit hollow i didnt really care about any characters overall weakest pirates film my opinion unless you big fan franchise like me isnt really worth watch,4

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,gonna try not cuss i will start saying i wasam fanatical about all three first ones yes original still best but second almost every damn bit good plot creative enough felt necessary writing par first davy jones so freaking good oh my god he literally my favorite villain all time save agent smith third one has its flaws though i really cant think any besides keira knightleys acting being occasionally over top but whole its wonderful movie like sweet jesus hans zimmers freaking score movie alone goddamn legendary result i totally bought into romance between will elizabeth really just felt emotional connection whole series because much like emotion howard shores music invokes lotr but what makes third one so impressive how well handles all crazy plot while still introducing great new sht like brethren court,1
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,but im not here talk about how great original trilogy odds most you liked them too what i want talk about briefly before i tear dead men tell no tales shreds stranger tides what i gather fourth installment wasis not very popular i like ill tell you why while didnt have same epic sense scale adventure romance everything made first three so great still had good writing clever witty funny ever because ted terry were still writing them not fricking jeff nathanson omfg ill get him later i would urge you though go back give stranger tides another chance especially if youve now seen fifth installment i think youll find even though doesnt quite hold up against first three still feels like pirates caribbean all reasons dead men tell no tales did not here they,4
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,1 johnny depp has completely lost its like he forgot how play jack sparrow there were seriously times watching him when i thought he more mad hatter than he jack sparrow its so sad watch old jack idiot sure but he always clever he always suave always cool hes just silly its embarrassing im serious when i say he acts like mad hatter youll see what i mean fourth one he least still felt like jack sparrow,5
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,2 zimmers so called protege geoff zanelli so forgettable i actually trying listen his music but only times music stood out when he rehashing zimmers themes some you may like sissy voice oh thats all zimmer did rehash badelts themes bish please not only did he make badelts original theme sound even better he introduced so many new ones jacks theme davy jones theme will elizabeths theme even stranger tides added fun new spanish twist old stuff,2
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,3 salazar henry carina also all completely forgettable theyre worse than blackbeard who i actually quite liked philip syrena there hardly any character development them what little there felt so forced i feel terrible them especially thwaites bardem because theyre not bad actors bardem actually fantastic actor but they just got saddled one worst freaking scripts all time which brings me my final primary complaint fifth installment,8
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,4 jeff nathanson cancer i mean my biggest only concerns start because lets honest trailers gave no hint movie would bad were fact zimmer wasnt composing jeff nathanson idiot who ruined indiana jones writing but i never thought he could have fd up movie not badly he did like movie had so much going salazar could have been another great villain put alongside jones barbossa but he totally wasted minimal poor dialogue carina smith female astronomer could have been great female character her romance henry could have been done beautifully instead what did we get well i wont spoil you but i will say there one most forced predictable painstakingly banal twists ive ever seen movie regarding her character,10
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,so i said i absolutely loved first three i really did like fourth one enough i very excited about what they could do next one fifth one all my friends said franchise dead but i maintained fifth installment had potential amazing which did i waited six goddamned years fifth one just god awful so bad i actually now dont want see another installment i will honestly probably never watch again because its so bad almost taints my love first four,5
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,i tried think reasons give more than lowest possible rating any reason all i could think visual quality two norwegian directors brought so good them i give fifth pirates caribbean whopping two stars,1
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,thank you has been my angrily hastened unedited review dead men tell no tales,9
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,writing very minimalistic characters all former shadows themselves young character leads forgettable character development feels almost nonexistent lead female advocate womans rights seemsinstead just being really cool protagonist who happens female whole cast pretty much runs around doing nothing jacks crew gibbs particular have been reduced mediocre comedy relief quite few plot holes well being historically inaccurate parts i did enjoy few scenes not enough warrant rave review though p,8
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,ive enjoyed all pirates films but i think its about time they wrap things up,2
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,fifth installment piratesseries all means step up fourth all filmseries when sequel released its mandatory compare best one which case arguably everyone agrees first one may unfair but its reality now,8
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,pirates caribbean salazars revenge does give us some spectacular moments visual effects really astonishing some scenes beyond anything i have ever seen before thats impressing but thats not why i like pirates caribbean what i expect hope piratesfilm elegant witty dialog compelling sea battles jack sparrow fire last bit i think biggest reason why one fails deliver,2
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,my opinion johnny depp has lost his way captain jack i think thats natural after all its been 13 years since he first portrait character hes gotten older really shows combined really poor script regarding jack least makes all fall apart half time hes completely drunk really drunk not just usual jacktipsy half time he tells bad jokes which really beneath genius character like jack sparrow,1
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,film starts positive note i had good hopes could go somewhere but mid way through story starts split up didnt really have good rhythm addition i think there lot characters just dont do anything story adds humor dynamic,3
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,decision bring back orlando bloom play will turner fundamentally good one but im so disappointed hes involvement film seems disney only took him back promote film lure old fans back more if hes involved he should have major role,3
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,javier bardem does good job villain but nothing i will remember him,4
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,all all i would say i am disappointed i didnt have huge expectations begin but where i thought film would deliver just didnt basically its film technical wizards show how much they can do terms visual effects they can do lot its just not what i want,3
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,i wasnt expecting masterpiece but i certainly wasnt expecting not entertaining least previous films had great swashbuckling fun wit they told bizarre stories had strange characters all which had something offer film adventures were full surprises making them worth least checking out jack sparrow character actually worth waiting film had no personality no heart no passion nothing more than bottom barrel film cheap sex jokes physical gags most which were served jack sparrow he drained spirit he had previous films wasnt even worth time he screen nobody cared nobody tried full theater nearly emptied halfway through film what once film series known their cinematic experiences now nothing more than dried up corpse result disneys relentless need milk their products death,2
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,finally pirates caribbean movie i felt quite par original one i felt movie elements entertainment were quite abundant unlike 4th installment i think one funnier more thrilling gave sense happiness end time movie not solely telling story jack sparrow instead other characters especially henry carina were given quite lot screen time nice see jack sparrows charm wit plus his insistence helping other people,2
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,movie provided some background story jack while he young which very interesting see movie filled lots fun laughter but also few brief touching moments story good there were some surprises too high budget movie movie filled very good special effects some done industrial light magic i totally loved effects deads salazars crews his ship course very cool special effects end,3
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,i also felt movie did not have any dull moment beginning till end there were always something interesting see my wife i were entertained throughout whole movie which having duration little over 2 hours amazingly due sense excitement my wife able hold going bathroom till finished i guess she forgotten about while watching,7
Dazed and Confused,there spoilers review,10
Dazed and Confused,what great great movie if you want know what being high school mid 70s like rent film i grew up metro manhattan area we didnt have freshman hazing few us could afford cars although we sure knew about them lusted after them but rest movie so dead about my experience high school 70s its scary every character film corresponds someone i knew during time yes there lot pot smoking yes obtaining beer quite easy underage kidsi used buy bars when i 16 we made pipes shop class we hung out had parties night drove streets drinking beers smoking joints listening same music there were no youth centers though girls i knew were beautiful also struggled get into their jeans they used pliers too but they also put them while they were wet further get skintight look there no hiv virus worry about herpes not big thing then biggest worry getting pregnant everyone having sex all these facts also were no big deal most my peers grew up just fine now upstanding pillars community many today would like you believe example road ruin incredible great time film has interesting character development same types i remember philosophers heads now called stoners bullies waifs my american graffiti perfect waxing nostalgic perhaps but anyone didnt live through time will sill love dialog film deals universal experience point ones life high school 70s check out,10
Dazed and Confused,i graduated 1976 high school north dallas entire movie so spot its scary my favorite film ive seen hundreds times every time its like watching first time only someone there lived through those days could have directed such movie i drove 70 dark blue chevelle ss 454 4speed over 400 hp all goodies wooderson described starting car up listening roar engine burning out 1st gear while thick cloud blue smoke front high school 3pm while wasteddoing over 80mph 2nd gearoh yea i feel sorry teenagers today drive limp wrist fluffs metal pass themselves off cars these days,10
Dazed and Confused,i stoner like pickford smoking weed nonstop some mentioned heavy drug use not too common well our school beyond common before school during school bathroom football field after school our school had smoking area outside cafeteria where everyone went light up,8
Dazed and Confused,opening scene aerosmith sweet emotion slowly building up pickford driving his goat girlfriend school parking lot kills me every time i cannot imagine better opening scene movie pure genius funny thing linklater did not show getting licks coach principal all uninitiated back then all coach asst principal had say smith i want see you back my office now our coach had paddle he personally made he kept his wall over his desk had about 30 holes drilled covered black electrical tape when one came down you knew now all pc people coach would go jail assaulting poor boy hell back then called character building i remember 7th grade licks were given out,8
Dazed and Confused,soundtrack best ever might well back white rock lake lake ray hubbard friday night getting wasted head east nice touch every time i listen soundtrack i remember things i have not thought about 25 years man portrayed pickfords dad dead accent demeanor along big caddy tennis playing wife miniskirt puffed up hair,9
Dazed and Confused,some reviewers mentioned they did not think too realistic showingmixing lot sexual activity among freshman girls another point i must dispute maybe their school their town 500 their strict upbringing but our junior high high school freshman younger girls were pretty wild i mean really wild coming someone who lost 12 so insinuating things about 15 16 year old freshman pretty tame 15 16 year olds were world travelers us 13 14 year old guys,5
Dazed and Confused,there something about movie pulls me back over over again its hard describe im not sure what am i wooderson enjoys reminiscing am i someone prefers simpler times am i someone so sick pc people movie like dc like breath fresh air there something magical air back 1976 country celebrating 200 years freedom now within last 30 years seems most those freedoms have been slowly whittled away all left former shell old especially after 2001,7
Dazed and Confused,best scene me its tossup between opening sweet emotion gto school parking lot emporium scene hurricane playing background while past wooderson present pink future mitch walk into emporium while camera films every little nuance slow motion cockiness woods mellow pink innocence mitch put scene slow motion study their faces reaction shots their peers faces they acknowledge their presence,10

Dazed and Confused,if you do then dazed confused right up your alley if you dont then still watch characters dc cover all generations just cars clothing have changed,5
Dazed and Confused,dazed confused which takes place during 70s one best movies 90s really phenomenal how much talent ensemble if you want see adam goldberg matthew mcconaughey milla jovovich joey lauren adams parker posey almost completely unrecognizable ben affleck playing sort role he would almost never play again ahole before they were stars look no further course early movie director richard linklater who had made relatively unknown slackers previously who would go make school rock which almost good dazed confused,10
Dazed and Confused,taking place last day school small suburban town dazed confused brilliant ensemble piece rivaling anything done robert altman covers broadest spectrum teenagers imaginable we see nerds potheads jocks cheerleaders well incoming freshmen they celebrate beginning summer some celebrate less than others course freshman hazing big part movie both male female dialogue fresh unexpected lines about george washingtons proclivity marijuana why you just gotta love high school girls i get older they stay same age mcconaugheys character says herd mentality when fight breaks out demonstrate how alloverthemap dialogue can its always affecting usually quite funny,9
Dazed and Confused,course its acting characters really steal movie really amazing how many people movie went bigger things i said before affleck most surprising but mcconaughey had most memorable role older dude who cant seem let go his youth slick slimeball who chases after underage jail bait he has never been funnier better than he eventually his character will wake up kids arent going want hang out him girls arent going want sleep him anymore hes going have rude awakening but time being hes all macho cool swagger mcconaughey pulled off part perfectly parker posey also excellent playing senior bitch but only because shes supposed unleashing humiliating hazing incoming freshman girls,5
Dazed and Confused,you have give props writing its not long movie but covers so much ground feels big one point character says 70s obviously suck may have been but its never looked cooler than did dazed confused soundtrack must mentioned too 70s decade full musical highs lows thankfully soundtrack highlights highs while ignoring lows we have songs aerosmith zz top dr john war other seminal 70s rock figures curiously missing dazed confused led zeppelin but thats forgivable brilliant theres not single clunker adds free easygoing atmosphere movie dazed confused quite possibly best teen movie ever made point view someone who grew up 80s anyway best movie about 70s ever made,10
Dazed and Confused,i must concur other reviewers who have commented eerie accuracy film i too attended high school texas 1970s film so flawless recreating time place lends impression you were being documented without your knowledge if you age background permits you relate dazed confused level will give you unusual affinity film exactly how we dressed wore our hair those cars we drove music we loved looks exactly like my high school only slight variations paint colors those seemed my teachers all these people were people i knew then there no question but author piece had have been one us,9
Dazed and Confused,someone who there i hope i can clear up offer some insight into few points people have raised about film drug use well 70s my high school really hardcore drugs such heroin were virtually unknown we talked about but never saw but both marijuana lsd were common available sand your shoes my generation had very permissive attitude toward these substances my own clique would never have had brass ones required actually partake campus getting caught would not have meant detention but trip jail other hand not infrequent find us stoned class but we did leave campus blow joint absolutely usually either home one us who lived nearby van belonged another our group parking shopping center down street dc we see slater some his friends smoking weed right schoolyard didnt happen my school there wasnt single teacher my high school who would not have immediately recognized odor marijuana sought out source clarity thirty years hindsight i remain opinion we frankly had healthier attitude subject than do socalled role models today bad drug problems bad drug problems but recreational use marijuana substantially less detrimental than either alcohol tobacco which both get free pass because theyre legal marijuana also failed serve gateway drug our clique none us were led into harsher substances im glad im not high school today,4
Dazed and Confused,one point particular discussion i have noticed here dcs imdb page movies rather brutal depiction hazing busting freshmen several have reported did not occur their school you were lucky glad i attended high school dallas 1970s absolutely part our life i like all girls spared brutal whippings mitch his friends have inflicted upon them seniors but absolutely happened incoming freshmen boys generally sanctioned least overlooked adults charge record yes assualt battery dang what else do you call violently beating someone board until they cry battery plain simple outrageous mean spirited cruel frankly homoerotic assfixated nature hazing paints far more unflattering psychological portrait those dealing out punishment than those receiving girls we were least not physically assaulted but we did undergo some nasty initiation rituals but usually only those us trying get into organized club not just all us en masse simply because our age also depicted quite accurately film what those poor girls endure bitch get cheerleading squad god love em likewise plainly obvious film just real life senior boys learned bizarre monkeylike behavior those bastions simian progress their coaches roles universally filled academic failures who represent woodersons future,3
Dazed and Confused,disturbing hazing belongs film because there real part our lives time place i felt delicious satisfaction when one kids mom met obannion front porch cocking shotgun i dont think so creep you go girl both mitch sabrina deal initiation rituals manner respected their older peers grants them access cool clique too intrinsic storyline removed whitewashed i might add only movie i have ever seen captures,9
Dazed and Confused,summation movie directed rather specific audience my friends who dramatically different age grew up different part country do not generally relate movie nor enjoy same level although they often find entertaining but if you like filmmaker were texas high school student those amazingly permissive 1970s didnt particularly hate your life time i think youll absolutely love highly recommended,2
Twister,i get lot stick friends saying but i really like twister i enjoy good thoughtful film much next stuckup film snob but i also love damned good action flicks,7
Twister,twister big dumb summer blockbuster no pretensions whatsoever i like fact money all up there screen lots tornadoes ripping apart farmhouses throwing trucks around i like its one long chase movie i like looking helen hunts beautiful face i saw twister twice cinema least three times since ive enjoyed every single time can you get better recommendation than,7
Twister,twister will never satisfy some people particular those who watch some strange reason expecting cerebral masterpiece enjoy what one best summer blockbusters ever,7
Twister,ever since films release 1996 its very title has become synonymous bad films its been labelled stupid loud dumb every other thing you can think whilst i admit script aint hot theres no real story film action great special effects brilliant film moves fast provides slambang rocking good ride im sorry more films like not made i love film when i saw theatre i blown away no pun intended bill paxton does good job lead yeah people have said he dull they should have found someone more charisma puhllleassseee ill watch film thousand times between now day i die all geniuses out there who call film crap i hope you all get swept up windstorm i really do great job jan debont,10

Twister,so how does twister hold up over these years not so well effects still amazing but thats about i do have admit even though its bad movie i still enjoy like crazy i think because if you let go how unrealistic you can just have fun want destruction chaos granted i know movie bit stupid our two leads bill jo survive impossible facing f5 twister twisters always disappear our heros danger bills fiancé puts up quit bit before realizing he jerk putting her through all danger him jo scientist thinks tornados serial killers not mention record breaking day numerous twisters but still bad acting bad story stupid some these situations may its still fun movie watch i think i wanna fair rating just because mindless entertainment its classic 90s disaster movie besides has flying cows what other film will give you kind situation but its all good i think they were taking cows mcdonalds anyways,8
Twister,10jul,7
Twister,twister my opinion really good action thriller personally i dont know how people can bash movie i thought amazing film acting great special effects excellent action intense film actually has great storyline me 5910 rating film atrocious i think film deserves so much better i thinking somewhere between 7 810 but i have my opinion other people have their own right i just find hard believe people dont like movie,8
Twister,twister has everything i like action movie has amazing special effects heartstopping action reasonably well written storyline even has some heartbreaking parts which almost brought tears my eyes i dont usually cry during movies however i almost cried during twister jan de bont has created very enjoyable maybe doesnt come up masterpiece material but still memorable action movie wont forgotten long long time,7

Twister,hey people come give twister another chance films even action films dont have have inventive plot decent performances script wasnt written machine good all i need light noise lotsa splosions take those elements paste over thin layer wornout story borrowed 10 twelve other movies you got winner thank you throw some great actingbill paxtons staring dirt moment alone floors me ever notice how helen hunt constantly bustling about her head down whenever shes not scrunching her face into her patented im sad cute look hello oscarthats acting jamie gertz welcome back cinema i havent seen you since listen me dont even get me started lovable ragamuffins known storm chasers way theyre thrown us like well immediately love them way youre not sure how many them there fat redhared dude thats what they mean cool i mean coolage cary elwes what great villian hes moneyhsss first i wasnt sure what accent he doing since changed every scene but then i realized he doing all them fx wowww movie follows rule we got computer who needs script i love how characters find big tornado endon perfectly sunny day no lessand drive right up no damage done i cant wait try myself i just hope i have lots cans delicious refreshing pepsicolatm,8
Twister,sum up rollercoaster wrapped inside thrillride movie i implore you give second chance please dont get hung up notion big budget action film could actually daring original even little smart all we need cgis thx sound films made marketing department studios keep us happy give me more im waiting,7
Twister,twister fun movie watch i think bill paxton helen hunt give excellent performances movie has great soundtrack i do not know why people hate movie one jan de bonts best films he also directed one my other favorite movie speed normally i think all van halens songs trashy except songs twister i like sound visual effects film not since wizard oz have i seen better tornadoes first time i saw movie i blown away i actually like better than independence day i really like end song respect wind performed edward alex van halen i wanna get twister soundtrack,6
Twister,being west coast i never had whole lot interest natural phenomena showcased film where i live inch rain headline news i had absolutely no interest twister until i saw late one boring night having nothing better do i obliged television payed attention i found twister what i call nice bedtime movie while failed anthropomorphize tornado way backdraft successfully did fire characters were well fleshed out there healthy balance comedy drama time cutting edge special fx i found long viewer came no expectation twister would fun easy watch nappy time movie perfect watching rainy day curled up blanket so sum everything up dont expect epic emotionally charged extravaganza but if you willing accept decently woven story reasonably believable characters have rainy afternoon kill check out twister you shouldnt too disappointed,8
Twister,i thoroughly enjoyed twister i saw theaters completely blown away no pun intended i loved big loud thrilling action sequences fun characters although most people criticize writing being poor i actually thought most quite clever unlike worse action movies you actually understand characters personality,1
Prisoners,prisoners gritty incredibly wellacted suspenseful thoughtprovoking crime drama thriller film mainly focus choices taken consequences faced characters when worst things happen them,8
Prisoners,simply raises question when your kids life stake how far you willing do protect your family explores likelihood human behaviour when such crime happening us blurring lines between good bad people,10
Prisoners,153 minute movie story does unfolds slow solemn pace which hurts film might bore some audiences but dramatic scenes performed main cast members film will keep you engaged hugh jackman jack gyllenhaal both giving intense oscarworthy performances here defining developing their characters various layers emotions affection anger grief empathy guiltthroughout film,10
Prisoners,films atmosphere heavy rains stormy days icy cold winter managed create dark dreadful environment make up dreary haunting mood film every violent action taken characters acts desperation given they running out time,8
Prisoners,however film not perfect despite some plot problems various twists turns shown film superb performances casts sufficient enough make story succeed believable,9
Prisoners,highly recommended those who wanted watch serious drama thriller powerful engaging acting performances its talented casts,7
Prisoners,httpyjcoolblogspotcom201309moviereviewprisonershtml,8
Prisoners,one intense moviegoing experience throughout entire running time movie suspense never lets up,8
Prisoners,director masterfully weaves haunting atmosphere i edge my seat plot wonderful puzzle unraveling slowly reveal hidden layers depth complexity acting wonderful emotional nuanced some unforgettable moments two leads gyllenhaal jackman give their career best performances but biggest achievement my opinion paul danos musical score contributes sense dread well rich sound design chilly color palette breathtaking cinematography,10
Prisoners,all those parts add up rare gutwrenching dark fascinating masterpiece kind lingers you long after credits roll,8
Prisoners,if you think someone being prisoner you automatically might think someone behind bars but apart physical prison prisoner can also trapped mentally either his own doing someone else movie starts off pretty light gets very heavy carried its actors gyllenhalls characters might seem odd out place beginning even like cardboard cutout but he does have more do movie progresses,9
Prisoners,still front row seat hugh jackman while some might argue female should have bigger role you only have so much time tell story perfectly told cut together might not fit your description entertainment i dont think filmmaker would love described such but movie really great if you like dramas general you should cherishing you will,9
Prisoners,we have few grey areas we visit ending did not satisfy everyone i know friends but movie could not have ended any other way my book superb movie one best released 2013,9
Prisoners,there sensitivity director denis villenueve writer aaron guzikowski inhabit bringing their newest film prisoners warner bros screen starring academy award nominated cast includes hugh jackman jake gyllenhaal terence howard maria bello viola davis oscarwinner melissa leo paul dano smartly constructed emotionally resound mystery thriller thoroughly enjoyable,5
Prisoners,synopsis fully trailer when two young girls go missing one belonging keller grace jackman bello other franklin nancy howard davis hotshot detective gyllenhaal assigned case relentlessly tries find clues could lead whereabouts missing when mentally handicapped alex jones dano found near scene disappearance no hard evidence keller takes matters into his own hands,8
Prisoners,i have say ive never been hypnotized works hugh jackman jake gyllenhaal jackman who fresh his inaugural nomination tom hoopers les miserables has capitalized massive way approaching his character ferocity made him star xmen franchises he hammers his way into every scene keeping audience guessing about their own moral complexities he tears into scenes way weve never seen him layers his character plenty affection empathy grief rage its his best dramatic endeavor hes ever done,5
Prisoners,when comes jake gyllenhaal many probably right reasons gravitate towards his work ang lees brokeback mountain his shining moment film history i believe hes gone deeper works like jarhead zodiac but those were just surface what he can do actor detective loki gyllenhaal stands firm tall one years finest performances terrifically executed man disconnected real emotion he finds himself enamored mystery surrounding two missing girls he also orchestrates character beats ticks thats reminiscent joaquin phoenixs towering work master last year,4
Prisoners,what very refreshing film offers great reminder how brilliant actor terence howard oscarnominated actor seemed fall wayside following his nomination hustle flow 2006 coincidentally same year gyllenhaal snagged his first now has realized his capabilities when he chooses more dynamic passionate characters film centers around his involvement paul dano doesnt have too much offer but completely adequate form,9
Prisoners,film however not entirely perfect aaron guzikowskis depth screenplay offers great mystery story full twists turns all bit tad predictable but thats not where he falters so much his construction female counterparts maria bello viola davis melissa leo not crisply smoothly put together id like them they each have one scene gives us their characters motivation look into their cinematic psyche however some thrown quite lazily manages halt story spots,3
Prisoners,films technical merits all rise abilities its cast roger deakins most overdue cinematographer business captures stunning portraits conversations weather scenes continue prove his brilliance film world films score masterfully placed jóhann jóhannsson while joel cox gary roach edit film impeccable pace,1
Prisoners,153 minutes film detailed precise engaging nearly throughout i feel theres shorter cut film would surely best picture nominee years academy awards if existed film could still garner support what they have now but i think there aspects film members wont able get around high level violence torture scenes infused longer run time could keep people distance one thing cant denied towering works hugh jackman jake gyllenhaal two have offered plenty memorable performances their filmography but their work prisoners cut clear their best theyve offered,9
Prisoners,prisoners magnificent achievement film year thorough enigmatic purely amazing mustsee movie lovers,10

Good Will Hunting,not only script powerful but dynamics between characters all them selfish even skylar vividly plausibly executed film just about manages avoid easy answers preferring acknowledge indeed highlight complexity pain personal growth selfrealisation,9

Good Boys,there some people here complaining about crude language jokes but honestly what were you expecting some politically correct dull boring fluff piece youre wrong movie,10
Good Boys,i havent seen movie made me laugh much since were millers there were very few times where i wasnt laughing movie yes jokes humor were crude but who cares can we not use crude rude humor anymore without people getting offended anymore,10
Good Boys,if you live such sensitive person you should just stay inside bare walls only your thoughts because if you live like then you may well not watch anything because might offend you stop being so sensitive everybody calm frick down,8
Good Boys,i laughing beginning end dont listen uptight naysayers if you failed watch trailer went movie expecting something other than raunchy inappropriate film youre foolish naivety actors what truly made movie comical so why bash creators using young actors deliver relax watch movie what fall out your chair laughing,8
Good Boys,you cant go into movie taking seriously cause doesnt take itself seriously its 90 minutes dumb fun thats,10
Good Boys,i havent laughed so much watching movie some time now movie good i believe most reviews imbb moral police society i guess watch have some fun thats what its made forand people who think tweens dont behave like bad news you all they do behave like,9
Good Boys,if you have enjoyed superbad harold kumar pineapple express type movies then you will love good boys they should have named movie superbad highschool superbad1 minus one i stressed out work today watching certainly helped me relax,9
Good Boys,its important note movie very very inappropriate not everyone i loved almost everything about top having rough time my life really uplifted my spirits no matter what anyone thinks its definitely worth chance i loved rebellious humor soundtrack made me smile cast great believe not there some well written dialogue,8
Good Boys,loved movie movie stayed true most 12 year old boys every where my 17 year old cursed like his friends 1112 when he thought we couldnt hear i laughed out loud throughout movie go see,3
Good Boys,i can see most bad reviews target normalisation such outrageous teen behaviour i understand why can debatable but comedy gives comedic spin subject weather parents like not all teens experiencing awkward curiosity transition sexualromanticgender interest important aspect clearly advertised 15 audience,9
Good Boys,yes cliche didnt present any innovative screenplay some jokes were obviously hyperbolised but actually hilarious film comedic experience overall journey throughout movie well written acting good bond between 3 bin bags members quite well portrayed i like carried also message about friendship cast well selected diverse main characters were actually very strongly individualised which i think gave big plus glue story overall i would recommended fun trip cinema but definatelly not movie more conservative taste comedies,6
Good Boys,good boys sporadically funny but quickly falls apart due lazy writing wonky plotting repetitive gags 310,2
Good Boys,good boys hardr comedy directed gene stupnitsky bad teacher year one produced seth rogen company responsible films such superbad sausage party film revolves around three 6th grade kids who invited kissing party since they have no idea what theyre getting into three boys try do some research practice before party quickly leads trouble each attempt fix things only digs them into deeper whole while 3 leads have some decent chemistry theres little they can do support thin material theyre given work good boys sporadically funny but falls apart due lazy writing wonky plotting repetitive gags,8
Good Boys,warning spoilers ahead,8
Good Boys,opening scene film things seem off dialogue bizarre forced especially maxs father he comes into maxs room says hes proud him learning sexually himself yes really happens,10
Good Boys,first act we get know max lucas thor while all three young actors do solid job material cant save thin characterization repetitive jokes theres gag early where max brings out his dads cpr doll practice kissing but its actually sex doll not much later thor brings out weapons his parents closet but they turn out actually sex toys,8
Good Boys,many jokes follow same copypaste formula kids presented subject matterobjects they misinterpret misunderstand audience more aware than kids most situations so you could drop them into basically any scenario jokes practically write themselves film coasts along relying innocence ignorance kids its template cheap punchlines quickly grows tiresome despite occasionally chuckleworthy line,10
Good Boys,good boys reaches overarching tone sentimentality innocence tossing various topics common comingofage stories but they dont amount much film touches heavy concepts such divorce bullying selfacceptance but these concepts never fully realized explored emotional beats feel unearned underwritten,1
Good Boys,theres sequence towards middle where lucas gets slapstick bike wreck dislocates his shoulder afraid go hospital max thor decide take matters into their own hands theres multiple shots where lucass shoulder clearly visible you can see someone forgot reattach prosthetic proparm between shots max thor decide pull lucass arm fix he cries out pain soon his arm pops back into place things go back normal immediately lucas sits upright says my parents getting divorced scene changes slapstick humor childhood drama split second sequence especially sloppy its execution abrupt awkward tonal shift,10
Good Boys,comedy has different appeals everyone so you may get more out movie than me said its practically indefensible being great film plays things too safe doesnt have enough ideas none emotional beats ring true there some funny moments sprinkled throughout action sequence involving paintball gun extremely entertaining but mostly youve seen all before better films if you havent itd much more worth your time seek them out instead sitting through good boys your local theater,10
Good Boys,10mar,1
Good Boys,i dont understand bad reviews film given who creators were i mean come you should know what youre getting yourself into here if you found those other movies funny 100 go see people giving one star just trailer without even seeing shouldnt even allowed rate,10
Good Boys,its been awhile since ive laughed pretty much through entire movie like one i am willing bet those bad reviewers havent even seen other movies these guys because sausage party had worse scenes than but all same type humor i loved my friend loved were both chicks were laughing throughout whole thing,1
Good Boys,when entire theater completely full no seats left all laughing clapping throughout whole thing those bad reviewers minority,1
Good Boys,its coming age comedy movie slight original twist tweens its mostly good fun but certainly not laugh out funny however didnt make much sense unlike likes classic superbad more recent booksmart what not recommended very light evening,8
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,hobbs shaw very mixed bag but its mostly fun affair laughs action chemistry set pieces all there along two great cameos car chases feel rote more franchise obligation than necessary part story idris elba evil brixton quite good so maybe he will next 007 most problematic about film third act but overall i had good time i really did enjoy soundtrack if you want mindless mayhem hobbs shaw delivers,7
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,rating 76,7
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,like i said its not masterpiece certainly has some problems but movie knew exactly what needed what needed do did well statham johnson ilba rest cast all did pretty good action over top but entertaining exiting movie also pretty self aware wasnt arrogant other ff movies i loved choice make ff movie such bizarre over top plot some points movie got little repetitive cliche me some jokes skits were little bit weaker than others but like i said movie not one made masterpiece analysed messages deeper meaning its just dumb summer movie but really good one,8
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,bit what two stars supposed though dont ask me who who if you insist id say statham unstoppable force dwayne immovable object which would make sense since he rock ok kidding aside now we know unlikely team made waves last fast furious movie andwas best thing about least funniest thing about,8
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,so if you liked you came more same you will treated way you should not expect anything other than just silly action all accompanies idris elba has quite appearance early but cannot add after he just stepping stone im being bit unfair he has quite few moments still overall you might bit disappointed his character but obvious continuation hobbs shaw might shed some light who am i kidding made enough money them continue,8
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,but i just couldnt so obviously refusing take itself seriously you couldnt help but swept up fun yes its over top unsubtle about deep politicians sense honesty but i found myself enjoying banter its movie you can watch half eye chuckle just watch no preconceptions enjoy ride,8
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,ok so only bad thing i can think say about movie story just ok has been done before stop bad guys getting virus ok its been done but being said action parts which almost whole thing done really well i really enjoyed watching movie there where some corny parts course but i can over look those just really fun movie i am actually looking forward sequel despite there being so many these movies already i really want know actor behind voice end see which pervious movies person ends up coming movie wont end up being classic but i highly recommend watching fun afternoon,9

Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,statham johnson clearly having lots fun making first final act clearly best parts film when pair doing their separate things falters second act which shame because elbas bad guy true cinematic villain full speeches protuberance envy all makings brilliant antagonist,8

Crazy Rich Asians,al these reviewers here calling film romantic romcom must have twisted sense what romance romantic film half comedy half tragedy there no romance bunch newly rich who spent their childhood riding mules now millionaires marrying money marrying sex cheating philandering passes romance nowadays well i think not think cinderella other fairy tales now reverse image these very plastic capitalist materialist greedy human replicas how sad,2
Crazy Rich Asians,what really sad all people cinema looking thinking how they want not understanding these gross sham humans disgusting shahs sunset kardashians,3
Crazy Rich Asians,first my disclaimer i used date one girls film interestingly one issues us what you see film which all need money glam fashion latest item said lady shall remain nameless i did not find film so good because i have almost lived doesnt have aura me but there funny moments may exotic some people threater seemed enjoy i say give shot wait video but watch anyway oh hi angel,2
Crazy Rich Asians,materialistic story superficial acting couldnt help rolling my eyes people still think marrying rich god digging cool strongly disgusted,3
Crazy Rich Asians,ut goes promote billionaire parties frivilous tourism jet setting spur moment flights having bachelor parties super tankers seven seas,3
Crazy Rich Asians,women were slender so i looking some flaunting least save film andtherewasnonezeronada,3
Crazy Rich Asians,super lame obnoxious attempt humor completely unnecessary boring predictable mediocre acting extremely simplistic story two thumbs way down,3
Crazy Rich Asians,gold diggers shallow superficial they want marry millionaire will back stab anyone travel anywhere do,3
Crazy Rich Asians,unfortunately they 30 years behind times joker suit women very long prairie skirts retro hoot my goodness i guess you cannot buy taste,5
Crazy Rich Asians,we watched film over weekend i am not rich so may come across sour grapes but i find display wealth driving flashy cars showing off expensive clothes embarrassing shows our society laws have failed when some people have too much others have too little,3
Crazy Rich Asians,watching film worried me promoting gold digging back stabbing course many say film mocking gold diggers but if so very implicit many viewers may have missed regardless they say any publicity good publicity so either way young old women may watch think marrying rich tall handsome more important than marrying good man pity if women attracted steel gold aluminum over humanity,2
Crazy Rich Asians,film sourced novel likely pulp fiction genre,1
Crazy Rich Asians,then she bond girl she old christian coot now how mighty have fallen least part accurate dont people grow old become scared senile find christ,5
Crazy Rich Asians,dated clothing long anklelength skirts oh my settings food gold diggers i cried vomited up during entire movie,2

Crazy Rich Asians,if so movie you go forth marry money take care your house has extra bathrooms huge island kitchen you post your vacations photos often enough instagram wherever people do stuff,1
The Parent Trap,there only one movie history i can name my wife my mother my sixyearold daughter enjoyed equally,7
The Parent Trap,astonishly effective pleasant remake very good film its light romantic touching downright funny you cannot pour enough accolades young lindsay lohan who effortlessly plays both twins if you listen closely juggles four accents she changes her brit accent when she plays her own american alterego pretending herself england if you saw film you know what i mean,8
The Parent Trap,natasha richardson dennis quaid big goofy infectious smile give film its romance maturity without stepping funfilled kids plot simple easytowatch family entertainment,10
The Parent Trap,there also great editing effects element you never once notice split screen cheap overtheshoulder shot when both lohans characters onscreen its really quite astounding how seamless,10
The Parent Trap,my daughter after seeing theater quickly proclaimed her favourite movie ever we own video i have watched her least dozen times without growing tired,8
The Parent Trap,perfect rental after bad day when you want have family movie night out,6
The Parent Trap,i think best walt disney film i have seen since last flight noahs ark delight start finish every bit wonderful perhaps even better then originial ia welcome return good old fashioned clean family films disney used make soundtrack wonderful lindsey lohan great little actress who plays two parts very well i love her british accent dennis quaid natasha richardson were terrific playing brian keith maureen oharas old parts young actress named elaine hendrix great comic villianess i detested her character laughed my head off when those girls gave her just what she deserved some people might say plot old clichéd standards today but still works they should release double bill original i hope disney keeps making films like goes back good old days so speak,10
The Parent Trap,one those rare cases where terrific movie equaled its remake hayley mills carried dual roles twins learning each others existence concocting plot reunite their divorced parents splendidly 60s version lindsay lohan showed wonderful comedic talent early age delightful remake,10
The Parent Trap,its disney flick so comedy family slapstick variety you would expect evil stepmothertobe overthetop evil even called cruella de ville one girls shes character you love hate obvious chemistry parents randy quaid natasha richardson great begs question which never answered satisfaction why did they split up first place everything film symbolically shows they were made each other even their respective maid butler take shine each other,8
The Parent Trap,fx editing stand lohans two characters together magnificently done really looks like two actresses no split screens backs heads fakelooking doubles etc distract you movie lohan skillfully contrasts americanbritish accents mannerisms two girls you know believe which twin she any given moment,10
The Parent Trap,well directed well acted fun ill even forgive film makers ripping off strandedinthelake scene meatballs closing credit snapshots provide sweet epilogue tie up loose ends,10
The Parent Trap,good family oriented comedy worth rental,6
The Parent Trap,wonderful remake 1961 hayley mills film film much more realistic better acting lindsey lohan amazing both hallie anniei really did think she two people she portrayed two different charactars fantastically all different charactars movie really funny well there no bad actors plot just zips i give movie 1010,10
The Parent Trap,definitely worth seeing handinhand original version rent one video then go see other theatre parallels quite strong though world grows smaller instead californiaboston split its californiauk split,2
The Parent Trap,there some lines dialogue common both films feel particularly appropriate definitely winning like sisters no halley like twins musical throwbacks lets gets together also quite enjoyable,4
The Parent Trap,perhaps recognizing their target audience not only kids age elevenyearold anniehalley lindsay lohan but fans hayley mills original film more indepth rationale presented breakup parents appropriate romantic twist,4
Starship Troopers,film about ignorance conquerors fact war makes fascists us all now doesnt sound like lot fun does but guess what fun truckload least if you have pitchblack sense humour you do realise what film what wants achieve,10
Starship Troopers,paul verhoeven master making scifi films which worked both perfect mainstream popcorn cinema very intelligent social commentary direction he felt society headed despite fact overthetop satirical elements highly political undercurrents his two previous scifi extravaganzas robocop total recall were only appreciated few critics time those two films became huge hits box office because they also offered great action amazing special effects overall great entertainment,10
Starship Troopers,my guess verhoeven felt encouraged success so starship troopers he didnt just sneak some subversive parts he went fullblown satire sadly didnt go down too well audiences critics alike apparently most viewers didnt get film all seemingly good guys wear nazi uniforms what heck verhoeven even got accused being fascist took directors commentary dvd finally make once all clear what starship troopers about what writers directors intentions were,8
Starship Troopers,i wonder whether studio execs realised what verhoeven up film maybe director just took their 100 million dollars ran result any case unique oddity i personally feel par films like district 9 even stanley kubricks dr strangelove its masterpiece much like another glitch hollywood machine david finchers fight club films like rarely get made not such budgets because more often than not they end up flops,10
Starship Troopers,apart underlying themes surface starship troopers also has lot going amazing effects still hold up very well insanely intense battle scenes more blood guts than even meanest gorehound could wish so no matter how came about studio ever greenlit gave verhoeven 100 million dollars i one will forever grateful unique subversive masterpiece my vote 10 out 10,10

Starship Troopers,movie never fails generate strong reactions both positive negative,10
Starship Troopers,much negative criticizes wooden acting soapopera beautiful stars unreasonably military tactics lead enormous human body count,10
Starship Troopers,but misses whole point actors plotlines supposed caricatures themselves we presented seemingly utopian society where everyone beautiful world united under single government patriotism rampant,8
Starship Troopers,further movie goes more viewer realizes just how horrific supposed utopia really patriotism exploited trick young men women into going off pointless war beautiful people mercilessly chopped pieces their insectoid opponents united world government uses its control media brainwash public into supporting bloody war,10
Starship Troopers,yes nazi symbolism little heavyhanded but thats whole point intertwining perfect society such deeply evil subtext supposed disturbing whats even more disturbing how close our recent american history movie truly yes its caricature but its caricature very real frightening phenomenon,1
Starship Troopers,how different government propaganda ads starship troopers loose lips sink ships campaign 10 war bonds posters 1940s us how dangerous have society where everyone looks same thinks same acts same even their own death message behind starship troopers its chilling one,1
Starship Troopers,me works,1
Starship Troopers,starship troopers subtle insidiously subversive movie proved frighteningly prescient wake post911 uberpatriotism both heinleins book verhoevens film valid interesting political statements opposite ends spectrum heinleins novel criticized fascist time its publication all his obvious talent writer im inclined agree movie much sendup original novel satire jingoist american politics really shame despite squeakyclean heroes plucked straight soaps mormon extremists multipleamputee mobile infantry retirees propaganda shorts masquerading news vast majority still seems regard starship troopers stupid action movie some reason absolutely refuse consider might something more,1
Baby Driver,movie had lot potential started out great but began fall apart rapidly just after halfway mark,5
Baby Driver,more complicated plot could have developed but second half just seems rushed movie could have gone several different more fulfilling directions but went full cheese instead disappointing ends up being just variation last ride 2004,5
Baby Driver,spoiler alert,9
Baby Driver,its given being debt crime boss means your debt will never really cleared so thats okay movie,9
Baby Driver,you can suspend disbelief driving physics nondeploying airbags,5
Baby Driver,but,9
Baby Driver,doc sending third crew meet arms dealers totally unnecessary job they had next day because they already had all equipment they needed so whole scene forced just plot device,8
Baby Driver,bats proved he willing kill no reason so theres really no reason he would have left joe alive,5
Baby Driver,there no way buddy would have been able escape all those cops swarming him downtown then buddy shows up again later after getting shot chest superhuman villains nonsuperhero movie tend ruin whole thing,4
Baby Driver,doc remaining place where heist launched risk being caught no reason even though he knew botched made no sense just like his sudden change heart helping baby made no sense,10
Baby Driver,oh jon bernthal only movie about 10 minutes so not sure why he given top billing when hes pretty much just extra couple lines babys deaf foster dad had more lines sign language than bernthal yet hes not considered main character,3
Baby Driver,baby driver showy clichéridden irritatingly selfaware its like yappy drama society kid college who so consciously trying act cool breaking into song dancing around chairs drumming desks spitting jokey oneliners hand pistol flourishthe kind person cynical sob like me just wants punch throat,6
Baby Driver,central premise about young goodatheart kid forced into life crime order pay off debt annoyingly slick abercrombiefaced baby not only fastest getaway driver atlanta we later find out hes also selftaught music producer dancer talented freerunnerare you rolling your eyes yet,2
Baby Driver,main mechanic so lauded critics everything film revolves around music editing dialogue since baby constantly plugged into his ipod so we told drown out tinnitus car accident which killed his parents film essentially plays like one giant music video nearly every gunshot tire screech sassy put down edited meticulously beats riffs whatever track playing during sequence,1
Baby Driver,unfortunately songs didnt make hackneyed screenplay much more interesting while there some splendid car chase sequences too few my book one must endure cringey moments baby miming dancing james brown dull characters waxing poetic about song lyrics saying cliché bullhit like sometimes all i want do head west 20 car i cant afford plan i dont have everyone film pretty none gangsters really look like gangsters least all latina darling who cant even hold gun convincingly just there show cleavage lick her lips camera,2
Baby Driver,imagine most indulgent ideas guy ritchie tarantinos trash bin channeled through justin bieber video less style even less substance,9
Baby Driver,there no doubt people who will love being showy piece nonsense there some entertaining high impact action but its far genius some critics praising i saw group youngish people who all agreed wasnt good theyd hoped some bits were just plain daft,6
Baby Driver,leave your brain home perhaps youll rewarded,7
Baby Driver,edgar wright proved able create thrilling direction more than capable script our ensemble cast led sympathetic ansel elgort he certainly shines teen tough position who good guy being forced do bad things more than your average heist movie killer soundtrack fast pace driver youll edge your seat during most crazy moments,5
Baby Driver,i able watch baby driver during advanced screening last week yes its amazing critics say way uses music just so great its so different all other movies but isnt artsy way only critics will like movie everyone i went friend who really hard please when comes movies but i just knew he would love i right i never saw him excited about movie he about one its just so much fun watch but its also serious when needs has very intriguing characters but ill honest core movie its music i think second time i say but music works so well if i wasnt theaters i would sing songs even though its completely different reminds me bit fury road way makes you want punch your fist air cheer during movie reality i think its more mixture la la land grand theft auto its definitely not musical way go see movie i dont want overhype anyone but ill make bold statement say my favorite edgar wright movie ill shocked if doesnt appear many best year lists december least i already know itll mine,8
Baby Driver,i read early tweet described baby driver mixtape film attached proved accurate comment tweeter may have thought good thing but i certainly dont,1
Baby Driver,yes there some good tracks action sequences elaborate frenetic little too frenetic actually but characters dull unlikeable bear very little relation real world i simply did not believe them especially darling sassy kick ass stock character only fool would consider strong female character,8
Baby Driver,then theres baby whose laconic boyish demeanour makes him rather uninspiring protagonist his romance debbie cute little waitress yawninducingly clichéd too,5
Braveheart,academy award winning war epic braveheart extraordinary film set new bar genre story follows scottish peasant named william wallace whos pushed into leading rebellion against tyranny english rule when his wife murdered starring mel gibson patrick mcgoohan sophie marceau brendan gleeson film has strong cast delivers outstanding performances additionally battle sequences remarkably gritty violent which adds authentic tone film composer james horner provides sweeping majestic score thats incredibly powerful groundbreaking film braveheart does exceptional job depicting both valor horror war,10
Braveheart,braveheart rousing adventure passionate romance soulstirring drama short mel gibsons 1995 classic everything great hollywood epic should gibsons second feature film director revelation who knew mel gibson established action superstar leading man would capable helming grand medieval epic artistry braveheart story william wallaces legendary fight against english tyranny medieval scotland works strong action spectacle but more than braveheart heartrending almost spiritual experience rare film bellowing passion earns every towering emotion conjures,10
Braveheart,braveheart tackles ambitious task retelling legend william wallace mel gibson scottish warrior who led revolt against english occupants scotland early part 14th century after his secret love catherine mccormack killed english noblemen occupying scots village wallace begins rebellion eventually leads all way king longshanks partrick mcgoohan england story not historical retelling real william wallace but account mythic figure william wallace largerthanlife scottish hero mel gibson his charismatic best wallace his presence screen conveys every bit folk legend wallace has become might not accurate portrait real historical figure but exquisite visualization fabled warrior movie after all based epic poem written blind harry 15th century choice treat story romantically rather than realistically treated negative some but actually brilliant decision gibson screenwriter randall wallace romantic approach opens film up more emotion more drama more action than straightforward docudrama would braveheart relishes romance time place story massive scope plays all those timetested notes classic hollywood adventures braveheart sentimentalized version william wallace no doubt but also surprisingly authentic muddy village huts crude stone castles closequarter violence battle scenes braveheart legitimately unvarnished look into cold cruel world medieval scotland marriage idealism realism strikes heart what makes braveheart so special works just well tearjerker action adventure,10
Braveheart,one standouts braveheart battle scenes which mel gibson stages tremendous scale violence action appropriately chaotic but way gibson editor steven rosenblum cut between indecipherable mayhem punctuative killshots gives battles orientation violence effective every brutal blow winceinducingly severe not typical hollywood sword sandals action real visceral action carries purpose braveheart brilliantly captures strategy well barbarism inherent medieval warfare,10
Braveheart,braveheart fantastic action epic but outclasses those trappings there have been many historical epics have come gone before after braveheart but precious few them can compete films craftsmanship what gibson has achieved here almost miraculous he takes what might groaning clichés hands lesser director injects them poignancy they frankly do not deserve we get obligatory love stories death scenes speeches evil kings treacherous allies its all been done before but never such unbridled passion behind camera characters archetypes but they show what influence great director great actors can have character supporting cast so filled personality you just cannot help but root what could have easily become twodimensional placeholders james cosmos campbell brenden gleesons hamish sophie marceaus compassionate princess isabelle excellent angus macfadyen robert bruce does oscarworthy work man whos loyalty balances precariously between english scottish sides conflict,10
Braveheart,james horners music may underappreciated key bravehearts success mournful bagpipes spirited scottish melodies horners score downright essential films emotional climaxes which there many when those climaxes hit they hit hard thanks large part music horners score carries same earnest spirit rest production music braveheart precisely big bold story demands,10
Braveheart,braveheart masculine story simpleminded tale heroes villains executed brute force course exciting action movie we might have expected star mad max lethal weapon but real discovery braveheart its beauty all its violence primitive mayhem braveheart never lets go its absolutely rousing grandeur doesnt just allow you look appreciation demands braveheart cathartic way overpowers you emotion there shots film nearly brought me tears their sheer beauty alone when story characters images filmed cinematographer john toll music crescendo hits like wave overwhelming gratitude admirable thing about braveheart how gibson company stick their guns they dont conceal drama play subtly gibson allows tragedies treachery triumphs william wallace legend extravagant story sprawling romances passionate emotions let out uninhibited fury braveheart mans movie brutal action epic will satisfy any redblooded mans desire violence carnage remarkable thing braveheart also movie moved me like few have before,10

Braveheart,telling quasitrue story one mans conviction courage exact vengeance killing his first wife father hands ruthless king edward ii england who turn inspires his small province scotland rebel go war real fight freedom independence braveheart stunning depiction capacity human spirit overcome odds defy tyranny achieve justice respect dignity against oppression,10
Braveheart,although its retractors critics will dwell harp historical accuracy some movie particularly what part robert bruce played real life there no denying true power emotional influence movie its understandable particularly europeans how could problematic due their upbringing studying history but movie not really about being historically perfect its work art about things much deeper documentary not its duplistic hypocritical films haters dwell minor detail but perhaps allow historical rewriting slide give free pass something like tarantinos inglourious basterds once upon time hollywood,10
Braveheart,topic one dozens best parts movie when robert bruce plays important role one battles eventually movie does come around get roberts history back track more accuracy his part character battle scotlands independence,10
Braveheart,without trying get history perfect movie simply flawless its beyond flawless really flawless movie can just technical masterpiece very little power but raw power emotion coming off screen practically every single scene braveheart like inferno,10
Braveheart,james horners score one greatest scores ever any movie successfully enhances drama emotion each scene without coming across manipulative fits perfectly into every single scene used,10
Braveheart,there isnt one acting role not welldone one gibsons best acting roles guy who plays edward ii gives outstanding performance,8
Braveheart,greatest epic movie ever created history hollywood few years later another great modern epic gladiator came out drew rightful comparisons braveheart but while gladiator very good movie lacks emotional depth power ultimate inspiration behind experience watching braveheart,10
Braveheart,final act braveheart one most powerful ever put film first time viewer you really have no idea where story going go even repeat viewer still holds weight day there still nothing like just when you think its over you know how will end just continues twist turn then closes what probably best ending any movie history,9
Braveheart,addition all body braveheart loaded outstanding battle scenes incredible editing great dialogue rooted inspiration political strategy philosophy stunning human experience love desire passion suffering identity,10

Spider-Man: Homecoming,please take my review grain salt i dont really write reviews but i really felt compelled say something about movie its decaying genre,5
Spider-Man: Homecoming,im conflicted because i know my opinion getting more more jaded every new superhero flick but i am quickly reaching end my rope here all these movies feel so predictable cliché anymore much i truly want enjoy them becoming more more difficult,6
Spider-Man: Homecoming,main actors movie were pretty good but what can you do yet another weak story has already been rehashed other films writing felt subpar end came off being full gimmicks convenient sub plot,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,just doesnt feel real anymore doesnt feel believable feels like fantasy world created superfans who never take step back critique,4
Spider-Man: Homecoming,these superhero movies becoming more more uninspired while i try give them all chance i am just getting tired all feels like quality being diluted all matters anymore quantity all matters money,5
Spider-Man: Homecoming,i still hold out hope just look zombie genre just because there dilution within genre doesnt mean sporadic gem cant made however if you similar mindset me you might want keep looking elsewhere,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,thanks reading,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,lifelong spidey fan i expecting good things homecoming sadly i appreciate i seem minority did not deliver me,2
Spider-Man: Homecoming,lets start positives michael keatons vulture everything villain should added layer charm depth high school setting our youngest peter so far definitely step right direction tom holland very capable actor although though his voice did grate after while even menacing mac gargan potential scorpion great addition,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,now negatives i think casting flash thompson liz allen ned leeds absolutely ridiculous flash supposed jock who bullies peter not smaller asian guy who also member same quiz team throwaway m j comment end unforgivable,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,costume ai also didnt work me i appreciate tool integrate spidey into mcu but me he works better when he his own guy cloth suit overcoming odds mixture bravery science,8
Spider-Man: Homecoming,i can appreciate homecoming had some issues get over especially other movie incarnations covered his unique origin such depth brave avoid origin altogether did detract really getting us onside maybe 20 minute opening section peter narrating recapping his origin might have helped,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,ive no doubt younger viewers would have enjoyed movie maybe aim but fans 60s 70s 80s spidey might have wondered what had happened their favourite wallcrawler,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,me first 45 minutes raimis spiderman nailed sm2 equally good my gf who has no knowledge spider man lore left cinema me remarked worst one,5
Spider-Man: Homecoming,though i dont necessarily agree comment i certainly wasnt ready hail smhomecoming all conquering triumph instead rather weak chapter mcu series,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,sorry spidey i so wanted love movie maybe better next time,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,seriously worst spiderman movie ive watched first three movies my opinion were best film peter parker portrayed hyperactive silly immature teenager they make him seem very weak unimportant compared other avengers furthermore i disagree use gadgets high tech suit not how spiderman should portrayed remembered honestly spiderman my favourite superhero i grew up him but original spiderman not silly version im just sad people will now have view spiderman instead how spiderman used should,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,1 wheres spidey sense 2 annoying irrelevant characters weak sense humor 3 villains least intimidating out all spiderman movie villains 4 spiderman identity exposed so easily why he so careless 5 what happened aunt may why she sexualized 6 no connectionchemistry between peter love interest weak plot twist 7 lame jokes everywhere 8 too teched up spidey suit too many gadgets why he like iron man all sudden 9 too little webslinging,10
Spider-Man: Homecoming,weak story weak characters 410 movie,10
Spider-Man: Homecoming,spoilers review coming spiderman fan i want say if i knew nothing about spiderman movie good but sadly i loved him grew up spidey movie typical marvel movie funny parts but rest they hurt my inner child ruining spidey,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,tom holland great peter parker spiderman but producers creative team behind ruined spiderman i dont know how stan lee could could happy my god they ruined spiderman spiderman never needed high tech suit all gadgets damn voice helping him like batman iron man they made him look pathetic took away his intelligence spider man relied his abilities not tech movie made iron man look responsible creation power behind spiderman any kid could have been potentially spiderman iron mans help then other than sticking walls according movie no spidey sense no further explanation his abilities,10
Spider-Man: Homecoming,next flash my god what were they thinking him small indian kid smaller than tom holland even not jock hardly intimidating thats not flash hes suppose dumb jock bully not hardly noticeable nerd bully math team picking peter,10
Spider-Man: Homecoming,aunt may whatwhy they make her hot mom figure shes suppose old not long luscious hair sexy people hitting her all time why,1
Spider-Man: Homecoming,spidermans webbing lame made him look oblivious using he barely created tony did all work other than moment class we saw him making some end where he used his old webbing,1
Watchmen,over 25 years now i have cited blade runner my favorite movie all time after seeing watchmen i may have reconsider,10
Watchmen,first im glad i went see movie alone ive heard so many comments focused blue dick length movie some other such nonsense im sure watching someone would have been constant barrage commentary complaint no thats not javier bardem,10
Watchmen,yes movie long nearly three hours but unlike dreadfully insipid titanic end movie i wasnt asking those three hours my life back all such movies you must able look beyond literal,10
Watchmen,watchmen iconic iconoclastic deconstructionist revisionist laden allegory allusion consider example character ozymandias im wondering how many people who viewed film ever even heard percy bysshe shelleys poem same name character even quotes poem plinth his antarctic lair allusion amazing heres full quote,8
Watchmen,pedestal these words appear my name ozymandias king kings look my works ye mighty despair nothing beside remains round decay colossal wreck boundless bare lone level sands stretch far away,8
Watchmen,clearly one must see allusion work case superhero who hopes leave mankind lasting legacy but realizes back his mind everything eventually lost time ozymandias first poem i ever examined expositional point view i blown away use movie equally impactful,10
Watchmen,then there dr manhattan named course manhattan project which yielded atomic bomb his character allegory god his relationship man mirrors apparent detachment which god sees suffering world he created deity reference reinforced often one thinks oppenheimers citation bhagavadgita which vishnu takes godly form says now i am become death destroyer worlds,10
Watchmen,expository scene second act dr manhattan has sort recollection his life his account dizzyingly elliptical since he does not see time linear way others do scene has lyrical feel my favorite piece fiction alan lightmans almost unbearably beautiful einsteins dreams reference einstein cannot ignored,9
Watchmen,but real beauty watchmen moral diversity its superheroes each flawed different ways allowing us inhabit different ethical perspectives intellectually least witness their consequences everything rorshachs refusal compromise which makes him doomed fugitive ultimate compromise envisioned ozymandias who can dispassionately evaluate scenarios where millions lives sacrificed calls into question our most cherished beliefs where does leave you well thats you decide,7
Watchmen,purely entertainment perspective watchmen stunning visuals state art do not suffer sort mental rejection i have some movies present too many special effects swallow once reality watchmen doesnt suffer hollywoods apparent fascination camp comic book movies camp works some degree spiderman since hes somewhat humorous character begin but excess camp rendered fantastic four sequel unwatchable watchman proves superheroes can use more subtle forms humor such irony without devolving into camp cheap laughs,9
Watchmen,music oh music if you didnt grow up 60s 70s you will surely miss some impact but dont worry even second hand recollection such iconic tunes will suffice i am reminded painfully awful across universe which couldnt even pull together decent movie built around greatest catalog modern music watchmen does spades,7
Watchmen,i lold i cried people theatre applauded end i vowed wait 24 hours before writing review see if my euphoria passed hasnt,10
Watchmen,times did change after so many super hero movies one has become best one them,10
Watchmen,screened frebruary 23 australian media,10
Watchmen,theres no reason me expect i going like watchmen i knew cast interesting patrick wilson has made smart film choices dont rely intentionally subvert his good looks hard candy little children jackie earle haley icky little children im old enough remember him breaking away malin akerman cute but 28 dresses heartbreak kid do not superhero make jeffery dean morgan matthew goode director zack snyder did cool things zombies dawn dead made wild wacky movie 300 which totally indicated his third film probably going worth look butyou know whatever,9
Watchmen,so they all signed up watchmen based comic bosorry graphic novelthat id never read coming theatres less than year after ironman dark knight had redefined how good superhero movies could should here aspire,8
Watchmen,watchmen has turned out most complex exhilarating deeplymoving fantasy film since terry gilliams brazil surprises nobody earth more than me man did surprise,9
Watchmen,equal measure inspired vision alternate world echoes but redefines our own existence b subversive yet bracingly humanistic exploration role superhero modern literature c supremely adult take fetishistic pull heightened existence life saviour society creates d wildly exciting adventure story turns normal people into exaggerated victims their own creation then back into mere humans,10
Watchmen,exploration plot would reveal more vast themes but early stage its release i dont want risk lessening experience anyone,8
Watchmen,i can reveal billy crudup dr manhattan jackie earle haley rorschach create characters every bit captivating deserving oscar recognition heath ledgers joker malin akerman makes entrance world superhero timelessness will fantasy every teenage boy aged 15 50 flawless art direction set design special effects mesmerising soundtrack watchmen film revels perfection minor details,8
Watchmen,warned those expecting spidermanlike teenangst fantastic fourlike silliness will stunned perhaps not quite sure what they have found watchmen extraordinarily mature risky project hollywood role dice especially given similarlycomplex explorations social collapse vigilantism v vendetta most specifically have failed do blockbuster numbers,10
Watchmen,but watchmen something special deserving analysis discussion bold attempt commercial filmmaking i can remember watchmen undeniably unique movie experience rich perverse violent resonant,1
Watchmen,before anyone sees film zach snyder should given pat back he did what dozen directors struggled do twenty years he made watchmen movie seems unthinkable anyone could properly put greatest graphic novel all time screen but snyder has done pretty much,1
Watchmen,while not alan moores watchmen closest thing anyone else could have put screen snyder approached material enough reverence fans comic will appreciate film snyder has openly declared final act does include significant changes but alterations take place fit better big screen than original ending would have works because cuts down lot necessary back story which snyder could not include,2
The Usual Suspects,ah usual suspects my personal favorite movie all time dont let my bias fool perhaps its not best movie ever but its one i never get tired,10
The Usual Suspects,if you like flash bikinis breathtaking camera angles you wont find them here usual suspects not epic doesnt pretend its modestlybudgeted piece fresh director who later went do xmen movies far departure,10
The Usual Suspects,great gritty script beautifullyacted characters what many have called greatest movie ending all time some shining qualities make usual suspects object worthy praise above its humblelooking shell,9
The Usual Suspects,casting very unusual but somehow fits perfectly gabriel byrne convincing excon trying build new life when he gets drawn back into his old life stephen baldwin has role his career smartmouthed cocky professional kevin pollak takes big departure his usual good comedy self take more dramatic role benicio del toro literally takes onedimensional character absolutely nothing script give him character he fleshes out brilliant mannerisms memorable mumbling show incredible acting creativity kevin spacey we know him born movie his manners fasttalking yet shy gimp nature treat listen throughout flick,9
The Usual Suspects,without giving away plot best most genius parts movie subtleties after you see ending truth hits you like ton bricks you have watch again second time through youll jump up point screen whenever you spot clue you missed first time its even possible watch movie multiple times see something new every viewing its attention detail make deceptively innocentlooking usual suspects one greatest movies all time,10
The Usual Suspects,disclaimer not seen usual suspects yet then dont waste any time reading rent buy borrow i dont mind but watch before you bother reading any further,10
The Usual Suspects,one main reasons usual suspects leaves such longlasting impression viewer takes advantage gullibility audience first 100 minutes we delivered intriguing complex story which there seems no easy answer when final piece puzzle seems place entire film turned its head final revelation initially leaves you speechless then shortly after audience realises they have fallen brilliantly inspired trick second great trick film plays its audience making us think watching again well able understand slightly better what really going truth more you try make sense more confusing becomes its probably best not try look any concrete answers just accept we fell filmmakers tricks success film mainly thanks sense satisfaction audience left end film i think people love idea story when youre not sure who you can really trust along realisation films most shady characters filmmakers themselves,10
The Usual Suspects,aside twist film also unique way narrative presented majority story told series flashbacks crippled con artist verbal kint performance which deservedly won kevin spacey his first oscar films other oscar went screenwriter christopher mcquarrie who also directed way gun 2000 his brilliantly constructed screenplay its testament director bryan singer he able combine all these elements turn them into something which nothing short modern masterpiece his moody stylish direction help bring film together perfectly complement films dark tone mention should also go john ottman his skilful editing amazing score,10
The Usual Suspects,usual suspects more than just film clever ending revealed awful lot about film audiences showed us their expectations can used against them also film about story telling importance myth i think one most valuable lessons filmmakers can learn the usual suspects more interesting intriguing your story more your audience will believe,10
The Usual Suspects,usual suspects certainly not first film contain twist ending twist ending became one alfred hitchcocks trademarks certainly not last sixth sense 1999 also used technique effectively but left more subtle clues audience pick up their repeated viewings despite usual suspects remains one most innovative memorable crime thrillers nineties,10
The Usual Suspects,usual suspects has received lot comment its killer twist ending which while no means first movie history has proved enormously influential stand up messrs fincher shyamalan but movie so much more than surprise ending meticulously scripted faultlessly acted masterpiece stands up repeated viewings every single time i watch i notice some new detail get more enjoyment out performance scene,10
The Usual Suspects,movie really put kevin spacey map but everyone ensemble cast outstanding even stephen baldwin who has never appeared movie good before since i also got kick out paul bartel death race 2000 eating raoul cameo ultracool peter greenes laws gravity pulp fiction all too brief appearance bartel sorely missed greene one day mark my words will become star he deserves,8
The Usual Suspects,director bryan singer has yet live up promise shown here his subsequent movies average apt pupil disappointing xmen all acclaim he admittedly superb cast have received real star usual suspects christopher mcquarries sensational script one finest modern era one genuinely deserved its oscar,10
The Usual Suspects,really doesnt get any better than one greatest movies ever made any time any where truly unforgettable experience,6
The Usual Suspects,one day bookshop i flipped through book entitled movies nineties movie wasnt included how can book specialized cinema skip such milestone last decade any movie buff any cinema critic must have considered nineties fruitful era american thriller according ones tastes some will say best thriller nineties silence lambs 1991 others will pulp fiction 1994 while others will praise skies se7en 1995 me pinnacle present movie usual suspects 1995 its staggering story put mildly its sensational debut bryan singer which enabled put him map little help his accomplice christopher mcquarrie he signed unparalleled gem landscape american thriller even whole cinema,6
The Usual Suspects,average viewer who watches usual suspects first time might think whole crew concocted him meandering story leading thread spaceys convoluted story end projection he may feel puzzled will probably wish watch movie second time he wont regret singer mcquarrie will rejoice their masterwork gains several repeated viewings appreciate subtleties rich movie convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form five last minutes watch usual suspects like gathering pieces intriguing puzzle little like any other suspenseful movie but case singers flick one will never really able completely end so many things happen less than two hours we never really sure what we watch reinforced breathtaking unexpected twist end which makes our assumptions falter singer mcquarrie take mischievous delight taking viewer their nebulous scenario follow according spaceys declarations its obvious they raise more questions than answers its up viewer make his imagination work bring his thoughts film what inspires its pernicious charm,7
The Usual Suspects,spaceys story authors developed top quality script set clockwork precision singers directorial style virtually evolutes razors edge conveys increasing tension filled ingenious visual ideas served fluid camera movements singer his early thirties when he shot his film but presents signs seasoned author theres also tight editing unsettling score which cement movie its place winner more remarkable authors pull off gusto increase audiences curiosity throughout film spite somewhat deliberate confusion interest wont weaken until end which constitute apex unexpected twist which will leave audience speechless once they understood singers flick doesnt disappoint because there little but noticeable visual verbal clues which justify however has something unsettling we believe we end maze but theres more picture than meets eye maybe coup de theatre veils one more truth maybe also shrewdest ones will have guessed but result same any viewer singer puts baffled spectator his pocket,1
The Usual Suspects,singer quarrie show perfect master domain film noir ominous atmosphere nocturnal scenes which stay rooted mind deep psychology certain characters which give more substance film considering last point character gabriel byrne most interesting one former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself catering but caught up his past forced come back work i personally think byrne standout topflight cast movie boasts but dont neglect other members kevin spacey pocketed deservedly oscar 1996 rest cast doesnt stay bench maybe singer grants little shallow attention three others baddies gang but way its necessary underscore fact theyre lousy gangsters embroiled infernal spiral unable perceive what lies beneath all pete postlewhaite chazz palminteri make their scenes count too,5
The Usual Suspects,riveting storytelling painstaking flashback tight firstclass directing thoughtful twist topnotch cast usual suspects includes almost everything director would sell his soul everything contributes make stalwart model suspenseful movie whole cinema after first vision prepared mental gymnastics second screening,1
The Usual Suspects,usual suspects two movies one enjoyable first time you watch even more enjoyable second time round first viewing asks questions answered i could kick myself moment final few minutes second viewing interesting because when you know answers film becomes much clearer requires certain amount commitment though warned if you stop concentrating moment then remaining running time movie will spent trying figure out how what you missed has lead what you now watching,1
The Breakfast Club,we all remember being teenager crazy intense time when your high were higher your lows were lower every experience much more significant,10
The Breakfast Club,john hughes movie brilliantly captures environment era our lives all social rifts we all helped create ourselves i have heard said breakfast club melodramatic overacted simplistic if you subscribe flippant perspective you might well join vernon his office because you doing same thing he did seeing movie you want see simplest terms most convenient definitions,10
The Breakfast Club,if you really want understand film think back your own high school days think about your last year there dig out your old diary book angstful poems reaquaint yourself who you were then when you felt things more deeply breakfast club does not exist not highschool kids some suggest why would they need they live there exists all us who have already been through there who feel they above now exists so we can remember what like better understand ourselves next generation because you cant dismiss something you understand,10
The Breakfast Club,movie one best if not best 80s film there fact every teen character movie can related someone we knew highschool child 80s i can honestly say representative crosssection every high school north america geek jock outcast rich prettygirl snob future criminal they all exist some degree another classrooms every high school continent,10
The Breakfast Club,what makes film rise above rest character development every character film threedimensional they all change one way another end film whether not things remain way they long after film ends unknown adds rama most important scene film when characters group all open up oneanother describe hell their daily school routines personal fashion nobody likes role they must inevitably portray highschool scene but fact often inescapable film gives viewer some insight into how other people around them might have felt during particular time their lives,10
The Breakfast Club,each main characters film shines but judd nelson john bender emilio estevez andrew clark rise above rest simply put these two actors each put their heart soul into their respective characters shows,8
The Breakfast Club,end film viewer left make their own conclusions how things will carry forth im sure most people will do one movie left me feeling both happy sad each characters isnt easy make me care about film way even if you arent fan 80s genre isnt one you would want miss,8
The Breakfast Club,my rating 1010,9
The Breakfast Club,after reading some negative comments made about movie i decided make some my own yes younger viewersthis movie will appear outdated only thing outdated clothing styles music doesnt matter what year you went high school what school you even went there will always criminal jock princess nerd basket case movie best teenage movie no matter when you teenager,10
The Breakfast Club,film one most influential films i have ever watched reaches out you your touched no matter what little subculture you were shifted into whilst going through trials tribulations secondary school you could relate,10
The Breakfast Club,may have been clichéd but what film isnt we like certain elements we can relate otherwise what would we take films,4
The Breakfast Club,judd nelson gives convincing performance bender criminal he managed sway angry emotional making you feel him when he describing what things like his house he seemed have lot great lines including manilow comment emotion film immense considering teenage film touches 5 lost characters who seem searching some type approval acceptance just like ourselves ringwald shows just how versatile she very different pretty pink i heard ally sheedy originally went ringwalds part they swapped,10
The Breakfast Club,emilio estevez carrys his role off very well jock gets little cringe worthy when hes high end rushing around like loony but end ally sheedy certainly makes up,10
The Breakfast Club,ending good however even ten years later after i first saw film i always wanted know what they did next day,9
The Breakfast Club,such great film i can relate so much i love truly best you can watch over over never get tired,10
The Breakfast Club,i must admit i true loner high school essentially im now 33 im still loner who has become bit more jaded passage time said john hughes breakfast club seems me sort love letter all us who just seemed blend into background during our high school years course like everyone i also have favorite character film my choice allison who wonderfully played ally sheedy so my advice all who have read far try watch film your emotions rather than trying analyze film death,1
The Breakfast Club,ah breakfast club although i am child 80s i came along tail end generation x cast breakfast club were actors i looked up child still enjoy adult i remember my own mother big fan movie even though she adult children,8
The Breakfast Club,all brat pack movies remains my favorite even over two decades later movie still holds generations people captive sends us all into deep thoughts our own glory days when we thought life bs we had tough we were just few years shy seeing how tough life would once we escape protective circus tent known high school,4
The Breakfast Club,over over you hear people wishing sequel film had been made i am very glad there not one surely we cant imagine would have been happily ever after these characters they came together one day but like most high school relationships all good things must come end closest thing sequel movie would st elmos fire againall good things must come end,5
The Breakfast Club,one thing i loved most about movie tell tale showing intelligence least thought places school janitor movie portrayed janitor being hell lot smarter than assistant principal i have found my lifes experience quite believable its also sad i believe those employed education system could learn very important lesson about young adults way their minds work youth knows when its elders have forgotten how see things youth knows how use against them moral simple stay young,9
The Breakfast Club,parents have never understood youth world elvis used evil now hes too tame modern music enthusiasts just imagine how tame eminem will seem years now scarier thought who what could worse than some singers todays market,1
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,id really love tell you about plot i really would but i would struggle pull all multitude strands together jk rowlings story coherently explain them anyone if rowling had put ten thousand monkeys not million its no bloody shakespeare into room typewriters locked door i wouldnt surprised,4
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,let me try high level archcriminal wizard grindelwald johnny depp being tortured trump tower but manages escape flees paris pursuit mysterious circus performer called credence ezra miller his bewitched companion nagini nudge nudge wink wink played fetchingly claudia kim someone needs stop him all eyes albus dumbledore jude law but he unable do so since he grindelwald closer than brothers nudge nudge wink wink so reluctant ukgrounded newt scamander eddie redmayne smuggled into danger zone which suits him just fine since his love tina katherine waterston working ministry there couple currently estranged due topical bout fake news,6
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,throw potential love triangle between newt his brother theseus callum turner old hogwarts schoolmate leta lestrange zoë kravitz about half dozen other subplots you have well complete muggle sorry muddle,4
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,above all i really cant explain crux plot venerable diarrhoea exposition crypt during inexplicably quiet fifteen minutes given imwhocanbenamed next door about thousand other people left me completely bewildered bizarre event sea no spoilers would seem make absolutely no sense when considered another reveal end film i thought i must have clearly missed something id just not been intelligent enough process information actually completely bonkers actually i think its latter desperation i went fan site tried explain plot while explained there explanation aligned what i thought had happened but made no mention ridiculousness random coincidence involved,5
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,films mess which shame since everyone involved tries really hard depp oozes evil very effectively he proves nicely arriving paris doublesdown about 5 minutes later veryverydark redmayne replays his newtact effectively but once again i see i made same comments my fantastic beasts review his character mumbles again so much many his lines unintelligible,4
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,i also complained last time excellent actress katherine waterston criminally underused tentative love interest tina trend unfortunately continues unabated film youll struggle afterwards write down what she actually did film,3
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,jacob dan fogler queenie alison sudol looking all world some scenes like rachel weisz reprise their roles subplot goes nowhere particular,4
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,newcomers jude law dumbledore classact but has very little screen time hopefully he will get more do next time around zoë kravitz impresses leta,4
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,you would expect david yates david heyman potter collaboration product design costume design special effects all excellent some scenes truly impressive explosion parisian garret particularly spectacular but special effects alone do not great film make many reviews ive seen complain filler film setup film rest series i can understand view if you analyse film overall virtually nothing importance actually happens its like order phoenix prequels,4
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,i dragged myself along see one because i thought i should third series will really need sparkle make me want see if jk rowling were take me advice she wont she never returns my calls then she would sculpt storyarc but leave screenwriting someone better blame one im afraid lies rowlings door alone,1
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,let me start off saying i am big harry potter fan i loved all 8 hp movies really liked 1st installment newts adventures well movie just didnt really do trick me there absolutely nothing complain about visually movie even more stunning than first one even more beautifully designed beasts many other people have mentioned harry potter fan you just cant hate movie where fantastic beasts where find them only contained handful amount references harry potter series crimes grindelwald has tonnes enough hype up any harry potter fan,2
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,problem movie had me its plot rather its almost nonexisting plot movie just seemed serve background information something upcoming movies series which well undoubtedly have wait another 2 years more more like setup things come introduced many new characters revealed certain things about already known characters but yet some these things just felt unnatural if jk rowling just kept writing more more squeeze into 1 movie basically leads movie where biggest plot find credences true identity not really much plot all some reveals about characters also seemed bit strange but could just me all all all dialogue about characters made extra confusing know what movie about addition lacking much plot begin,6
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,movie definitely not waste money anything you could just buy ticket stunning scenes youd satisfied its just movie quite disappointment compared many peoples expectations i think seeing basically just setup upcoming movies which lacks good plot,1
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,both lover harry potter universe lover movie going i thoroughly disappointed even angry movie while visuals magical ever its clear filmmakers so distracted trying build franchise theyre forgetting actually tell good story chemistry between our main four heroes diluted so many new characters being introduced so many new people also so many questions our old heroes there wasnt enough time any kind explainable character development viewers connect anyone screen only character development one our main heroes felt random out character we arent given much reason warning change i also very disappointed writing behind tinas character her role demoted strong willed auror woman merely side kick love interest huge important elements story were left us only assume what had happened when discussing one year time jump between two films like jacobqueenie relationship jacobs memory etc whole film screamed money hungry franchise building rather than letting us really connect characters also seemed if they were only adding twists would surely get reaction viewers despite fact they not only discredited original harry potter films but just felt like unrealistic little too convenient short huge fan harry potter universe i disappointed upset felt really let down film goer i confused plot frustrated lack character connection development only reason i have given 410 instead 1 eddie redmaynes perfect execution shy socially awkward but loveable charming newt scamander alluring performance jude laws dumbledore who leaves us wanting know more his history but end huge disappointment standalone movie,3
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,watching gives you sense nobody really knew where go after first film ended shows beautiful film great cast but ultimately pointless story sort flops around like dead fish not quite aware yet its dead film disappointing forgettable,2
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,almost impossible keep up what going just jumped one thing next no development such shame,3
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,totally dysfunctional unrelated cast incomprehensible story tons tons computer graphics result confusing totally boring movie waste money,1
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,one thing movie successfully does cast obliviate you i literally just watched i dont even remember what its about magical element film simply having so much happen while simultaneously nothing really happens,7
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,theres little bit nostalgia easter eggs great visuals actors great johnny depp has most menacing introduction ive seen jude law convinced me he young dumbledore music spectacular but none can hide truth fact movie just boring,4
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,there literally so much plot thrown you nonstop movie expects you care about invest remember so many characters some point you mentally clock out im intense potterhead i love learning more l about wizarding world but just too much information being forcefed very little time ive enjoyed every single harry potter film so far but i just cant stomach story,2
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,remember end first fantastic beasts movie when you enjoyed watching itbut you hesitated gravitate towards you had small shred doubt if one time thingor does genuinely have potential something incredible theres no longer doubt,2
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,where fantastic beasts what crimes grindelwald not magic its cgi lost essential taste friendship bond between characters within magical context original hp series,1
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,if i were describe movie one word i would say filler only after movie i informed fantastic beasts franchise going 5 movie one after i learned movies purpose became so clear me i just watched 2hour movie which main characters had nothing do plot all movie all about grindelwald finding credence convincing him join his army so credence would kill dumbledore future newt tina jacob quennie did nothing movie but couplefighting catching maybe 1 2 magical creatures we got follow story about newts childhood love which led absolutely nothing main characters just made right place right time spectate end movie which grindelwald finds credence convinces him join his army boom movie only thing newt did stealing bloodbond between grindelwald dumbledore using niffler all all really poor movie plot shallow totally filler just gave us little bit magic but thats i give 4 only because i am huge harry potter fan movie made me really unhappy seeing my favorite magical world being milked money we dont really need 5 movies 2 being fillers all we needed 3 magical rides harry potter world thanks reading 410,2

Spaceballs,spaceballs strikes me how parody should made its not overbearing jokes spot pastiche references quite memorable most quotes film seemingly ridiculous plot because its burlesque nature doesnt interfere comedic purposes so plot humour go wonderfully hand hand rick moranis dark helmet sometimes simplest humour where its incredibly funny well john candy barf names alone makes one giggle great mel brooks makes his grand appearance too he acts accordingly expected man comedy genious proves movie after movie graces us his hilarious participations,10
Spaceballs,undoubtedly laugh star rick moranis i mean mightiest villain all time absolutely opposite what you would expect makes excellent situation comedy which perfectly executed every little detail counts comedy youll notice many nuances obscure references other films once you have watched couple times believe me gets better after each viewing spaceballs absolutely deserves,8
Spaceballs,duel scene between dark helmet lone starr spoof classic i am your father moment comedy gold course one things i absolutely treasure about mel brooks films their exhilarating selfawareness always gets me more absurd they make better example film when colonel sandurz browsing through some vhs tapes puts tape spaceballs very same film which they making moment then they watch themselves screen just ridiculously funny,8
Spaceballs,spaceballs classic my book watch make your own,8
Spaceballs,spaceballs one funniest movies ever tradition airplane spoofs nearly all modern scifi including star wars empire strikes back return jedi alien star trek planet apes mel brooks has had some funny movies but takes cake rick moranis inarguably his second best role after strange brew john candy has one his better performances bill pullman long way independence day central character lone star combination luke skywalker han solo sight gags classic memorable lines present here beginning end just looking dark helmet enough induce laughter spaceballs truly great film lets see how well you handle,8
Spaceballs,brisk parody star wars other great science fiction films pits bill pullman his mandogdogman partner john candy against rick moranis mel brooks they try rescue princess daphne zuniga clutches evil spaceballs,10
Spaceballs,cast clearly enjoying themselves theres gag almost every minute mostly notably star wars gags some best,10
Spaceballs,1 pizza hutt,10
Spaceballs,2 alien diner scene john hurt oh no not again,10
Spaceballs,3 yogurt yoda clone also mel brooks please im just plain yogurt,7
American Pie,i have say most fun i had movies summer when i saw american pie funniest picture ive seen since last summers theres something about mary movie has taken classic teenage boy film porkys revenge nerds spruced up 90s hilarious start finish if you like physical comedy gross out comedy sexual comedy american pie has all great ensemble cast likeable young actors makes joy watch,8
American Pie,i think years breakout star has chris klein he phenomenal election he even better here jock who tries soften his image score before prom i have feeling klein going hollywoods next big thing i hope he has chance flex his acting muscles some different movies i can definitely see guy action film,8
American Pie,also very good jason biggs who plays sympathetic jim character guy who least likely lose his virginity his antics very funny follow he gets lion share laughs finally huge ovation eugene levy who gets major laughs jims dad,8
American Pie,can you believe has been 20 years since film still funny amusing boys were boys girls were hot girls had long hair flaunted their bodies father super cool nowadays we have daisy disney star wars short hair looking all i have chip my shoulder aaarrrgh i am going stop right there american pie funny you should watch if you already have not,8
American Pie,funny scenes funny characters cleavage nubile desirable legs thin waists what waist,7
American Pie,i laughed so hard i spit out half bucketopop i drinking finally had stop sipping its fine nectar because so many times i hooting bending over joy,8
American Pie,there some slower moments let you catch your breath allow moments sincerity but only minute scenes previews ones you think will ruin movie you expounded tenfold so there plenty surprises,9
American Pie,during movie i kept saying me my friends when we were high school they were almost same conversations about life sex girls just not frequently but its only twohour film any guy will appreciate american pie full tilt girls will realize just what hoops guys jump through order get their attention let alone their pants,6
American Pie,what added american pie i liked every character because filmmakers didnt feel urge give us prototypical teen characters their personalities distinctive their situations all different which leads hilarious finale where we see just how their pact plays out prom night,10
American Pie,i mentioned before there genuine moments screen where guys gals have revelations sincerity adds needed depth film like where its not just raw raunchy comedy but important lives characters who know more than sex stake which another reason like pie there several slices sexual conquest only one them,9
American Pie,director writer paul weitz adam herz respectively will do anything laugh thats good turns out because movie has great many laughs theres not much restricting suffocating logic stuff around but american pie immensely enjoyable i mean almost none things happen film would ever ever come pass real life but doesnt matter,8
American Pie,starters characters arent all onedimensional thankfully theyre twodimensional so right away has edge 6070 all movies ever made,9
American Pie,moreover its heart right place most high school movies these days all about cruelty malice especially towards among women not case here first conventional high school movie ive ever seen made me smile so much i say conventional because rushmore still trumps every one them,8
American Pie,furthermore its very funny i wouldnt dare give away any really great gags weve all seen trailer thats not one i mean but ill say weitz herz extraordinarily skilled audience manipulation which say they know how when spring unexpected surprises upon us they also know how use foul language punch rather than punctuation,7
American Pie,soundtrack another positive its all about joy high energy even music third eye blind barenaked ladies suffers radio overplay fits mood appropriately,10
American Pie,i had good fortune see sneak preview film england couple weeks before release i very impressed indeed hurrah comedy laughoutloud funny enough make you cringe embarrassing bits which there many smile sentiment which isnt corny slightest comingofage tale four boys who make pact become men losing their virginity prom night perfect movie go cinema your buddies see but probably not your family having said i saw family son mother father grandmother coming out cinema they had great time grandmother couldnt stop laughing saying how true all which interesting if little embarrassing,8
American Pie,part success movie due fact weve all had contemplate how we feel about sex losing your virginity something which no matter how fraught peril bonds us all because very frightening experience its also topic which has so much comic potential im glad cast crew dont throw any opportunities away heres thing if youre going make movie probably going offend few people no matter what you do very neartheknuckle affair why stop only halfgags go whole hog push boat out thrust their faces thats what american pie does,9
American Pie,performances all great if little clichéd all you americans really either,9
American Pie,jocks,8
American Pie,b geeks,8
Requiem for a Dream,you will not so much want take sip wine after watching mesmerizing film about horrors drug addiction i not fan director darren aronofskys debut film pi but movie he proves filmmaker unlimited vision style four characters brighton beach brooklyn all driven despair due their drug abuse saddest being ellen burstyn nice jewish widow who unwittingly becomes addicted prescription diet pills help her lose weight but drag her into world hallucinations paranoia burstyn superb so refreshing see such great veteran like her such challenging leading role one which she goes through hell worse than exorcist,9
Requiem for a Dream,but directors film if there ever one aronofsky knows how tell story way dazzling its use sound editing cinematography score kronos quartet clint mansell most striking movie music i have heard very long time,10
Requiem for a Dream,requiem dream not movie everyone essence independent filmmaking daring engrossing artful film stays you long after you leave theater hollywood bubblegum aint,10
Requiem for a Dream,its difficult know what say about requiem dream i first saw cinema when released england i have never seen audience react film like one climactic sequence where protagonists effectively destroyed their addictions seemed trigger bout heavy breathing audience ending i heard few people crying my girlfriend i didnt say single word each other bus home,10
Requiem for a Dream,i bought film dvd day came out but took me around six months watch again only then because friend mine curious if anything impact heavier than first time i watched ive vowed never watch ever again,10
Requiem for a Dream,yet i have still awarded rating 10 imdb would definitely assert its one three greatest films i have ever seen why acting just amazing jennifer connolly gives best performance her career not too tricky considering movies shes been remains stunningly beautiful haggard sort way noble even when shes roped into gang bang fund her heroin habit jared leto annoyed me intensely fight club but hes perfect hapless junky harry forever exuding air kindly incompetence endears him audience but will ultimately destroy him marlon wayans equally brilliant wearing beaming smile first half film compelling look confusion betrayal rest,8
Requiem for a Dream,ellen burstyn never has actress been so unfairly cheated out oscar ive seen atrocity won marcia gay harden oscar she just picture sadness whole film through heartbreaking example what loneliness can do vulnerable people scene where she complains harry about being old honestly one most tragic things ive ever seen makes me want break down just thinking about,10
Requiem for a Dream,such i can only recommend incredibly important movie certain reservations if your favourite film youve got mail steer well clear if snow dogs has been your most thrilling cinematic experience year then put film back shelf trust me itll save costs incurred those expensive therapy sessions,9
Requiem for a Dream,however if you believe cinema important tool helping us understand ourselves we will only achieve self awareness plumbing absolute depths despair selfdestruction then you must watch requiem dream,10
Requiem for a Dream,im not going waste space synopsis every second third review provides one good indication challenging original film number 110 1010 reviews where 110 reviews consist just few lines pretty sure sign those folks werent able willing watch open mind which good sign casual viewers give film wide berth,10
Requiem for a Dream,i wish everyone i care about would see requiem dream not because they will like will teach them something they did not already know but its rare piece work will challenge probably change them its film has never been made before nothing compare rarity these days i often find myself recommending films people i am unable briefly describe these usually most involving affecting ones id like my family see but cant recommend them ive recommended two friends they both had same reaction i am glad i watched but i doubt ill frame mind watch again knowing what you feel,9
Requiem for a Dream,i sat watching credits roll i began crying but im still not sure why partly reaction devastatingly tragic ending partly beauty yes film partly my gratitude good things my life i watched again same night my girlfriend not because i wanted upset her but i felt i had share after credits rolled we both were silent good ten minutes i found i had thoughts i wanted express but could find no words one few films painful experience but i feel compelled share people i care about some others short list include thin red line happiness rivers edgeand deer hunter,10
Requiem for a Dream,these films all share quality thats difficult name no one likes feeling disturbed shattered film work art piece music but i feel experiencing these emotions being asked think not just entertained important now then,10
Requiem for a Dream,favorite does not apply me isnt about entertainment one most devastating beautiful experiences ive had watching film one top five films ive ever seen,10
Requiem for a Dream,i went movie hearing plenty buzz about how graphic content over course movie you see just how aronofsky wants send his message audience characters start off somewhat mild addictions then next thing you know four main characters living hell i couldnt believe how low they all fell movie may greatest antidrug message all time i dare anybody watch not touched frightened these characters before movie started i noticed audience quite loud garrulous but ended credits rolled whole place stone cold silent amazing,10
Requiem for a Dream,whole i felt movie excellent visuals were well done editing outstanding actors really put themselves into their roles jared leto jennifer connelly had very good chemistry while marlon wayans showed he talented actor not just talented comic ellen burstyn wow she amazing i cant believe older woman would allow herself filmed like she has some serious guts hands down best female performance ive watched year not even close i totally amazed her,8
Requiem for a Dream,all all i would say requiem dream great movie had profound impact me i havent been able stop thinking about since i watched opening night i definitely recommend movie anyone movie everyone should see but unfortunately not enough will,9
Requiem for a Dream,being someone who had history drugs i found movie slightly more than groundbreaking i saw film midst downward spiral turned me right around having friends same plans such sell drugs buy more drugsit made me look my life theirs see exactly what future had store,7
Love Actually,i hate romantic comedies i detest them you can list actors i avoid watching hugh grant sandra bullock richard gere julia roberts romantic comedies make me cringe i avoid them like plague so you can imagine foul mood i when i forced watch film,9
Love Actually,introductory voiceover hugh grant we watch airport full people hugging made me want commit act violence either against people who forced me watch film against myself just end torture,10
Love Actually,then most unbelievably shocking thing happened bill nighy gregor fischer came screen mocking one most hated love songs britain love all around i found myself getting sucked into film,8
Love Actually,time i reached end film i found myself facing impossible there one romantic comedy out there genuinely comedy actually likeable noone more shocked than i,8
Love Actually,many different kinds love covered although not all kinds theres 8 storylines biggest cast list ive seen long time somehow works youd think wouldnt i know i certainly didnt,10
Love Actually,if youre looking fulllength story not film you snapshots important events leading resolution couples involved nothing more if you want classic romantic film might not film you funnier than most straight comedies ive seen recent times however im just harsh critic comedy films i am romantic films,10
Love Actually,its not trying meaning life its not trying look big picture fact its only trying do one thing thats say positive feelings crop up most unexpected places more prevalent than people think one storylines one cited constantly reviews one failed storylines sad ending actually bittersweet doesnt end failure but failure one type love favour different kind,9
Love Actually,film isnt perfect ill never find perfect romanticcomedy because i hate genre so much example one storylines did annoy me intensely yet ironically still made me laugh places however flaws film vastly outweighed positives its superficially complicated but really very simple film makes statement love actually all around then shows why makes statement doesnt attempt do anything else,1
Love Actually,like fact covers different kinds love covers different attitudes portrayals so couple realistic couple classic fantasy couple pure comedy couple pure romcom tradition,1
Love Actually,i have seen no reviewer give film middleoftheroad review ive read many reviews i think end love actually up individual its like marmite you either love you hate,1
Love Actually,speaking cynical misanthropic marmitehating romanticcomedy hating member human race i actually liked love actually,10
Love Actually,has been long time since i have seen movie so rich character i did not want end love actually not love story story about love love reinvents itself multiplies itself opens itself up even devastates,1
Love Actually,i am sure film has its critics who say drips buttery corn but when you able retreat inward let take you over impossible not feel rare treat film makes you feel during process i sad happy relieved i turned turned off dizzy grounded,1
Love Actually,i love one time reminded me power cinema can amazing can intense title movie perhaps meant confuse yet i believe designed ask love actually what,1
Love Actually,lust deep appreciation past can conquered language political barriers race infidelity age can all above plus more maybe mingling several,1
Love Actually,rare film great acting married terrific script yet something else speak right audience not talk them not try sell them film let them experience film let wash over them little little until there nothing more them left,1
Love Actually,,1
Love Actually,most intriguing film there course other reviews here but one common theme seems exist all reviews simple fact you can never please all people all time,1
Love Actually,myself i loved film way all stories were intertwined you could spend ages just trying work out where various connections between story lines actually were,1
Love Actually,but there were two very special moments me film one where mark andrew lincoln finally told julietkeira knightley how he really felt about her through medium messages cards surely many us have experienced sort unrequited love other brilliant brief speech given prime minister hugh grant press conference which american president present both these appear quotes elsewhere site i felt very brave move part writer richard curtis allow prime minister film state what so many ordinary british people feeling about america its politics right now,1
Love Actually,i also feel we british finally beginning move away under hollywood shadow starting once again produce some really excellent films our own me film just underlines fact may trend continue,1
Love Actually,claire rosemary jane,1
The Truman Show,truman show epitomizes strong original storytelling screen film emotionally engaging didactic witty dramatic very unique those unfamiliar concept truman burbank has never left his ideal home town sea haven what he doesnt know his entire environment materialized set he ignorant star reality tv show epic proportions,10
The Truman Show,taking entirely original concept writer andrew niccol director peter wier take viewer into territory uncharted anything film history thus plot entirely unpredictable but still flows along expertly tightness screenplay immaculate pacing peter wier contribute largely films brilliance,10
The Truman Show,acting performances amongst best ive ever seen jim carey superb truman effortlessly conveying his fears desires personality ed harris excellent reclusive creator production addition entire support cast appears synthetic enough let audience know they acting truman but some scenes let their genuine feelings shine through ensemble simply cannot faulted carey hardly done not get oscar nomination his performance,9
The Truman Show,music visuals top notch cinematography has reality tv feel clever but never intrusive shot selection highest quality particularly movies final sequence muscially film incredible phillip glass dream piano perfectly evoking mood each section narrative two combine excellently during scene which truman breaks his routine first time during sequence truman makes subtle changes bland routine he follows compliantly every day emotion music when combined apparent simplicity trumans actions makes scene one most powerful iv ever experienced,10
The Truman Show,film absolute gem effortlessly combines everything classic film should have has comedy drama strong character development atmosphere originality superb visuals superb score tight writing raises interesting moral questions well providing insight into human condition one cannot watch spectacular film without wondering how human would react when put kind situation touches our sense adventure desire conformity courage we require question life we presented truman show does all most accessible compelling fashion one greatest films our time,10
The Truman Show,truman burbank ordinary guy ordinary little seaside town seahaven island where nothing really happens everything clean everything perfect he knows people but never really connects anyone one woman he ever really loved not his wife has long since left other side world where he longs visit but feels he can never go paralysed his fear water since seeing his father die boating accident truman still feels he missing something strange light falling sky man who reminds him his dead father strange radio broadcast feeling world really stops when he shuts his eyes all combine make him feel something wrong  but what he seeks but feels he cannot find,10
The Truman Show,when i first saw film my girlfriend who would then become my wife then exwife i remember how she our friends felt little bit cheated film they had expected yet another wacky jim carrey comedy fairness her others easy do time  who would have thought jim carrey would able act  certainly not marketing department sold film basis being hilarious film opposed thoughtful rewarding film turned out plot can viewed so many levels honestly easier leave each viewer take what they will most obvious level satirises media emotional façade television increasingly relevant look reality shows others will say much about god empty drone life things we all desire course others will just comedy general comments make  there nothing wrong whatsoever fact multilevel approach works make appeal many audiences,10
The Truman Show,starting comedy i am always taken how well film moves become more more interesting but yet never loses sight those audience members who have come basic story hence delivers enjoyable engaging central narrative plainly put makes comic involving yarn  we grow care truman makes ending emotional satisfying one even if some viewers will bemoan fact them appears open ended also very thoughtprovoking affair only bonus satire working many levels course seeming tackle so many subjects issues such short running time film never really gets its teeth deep into any one them but not major problem because leaves us do our heads after film finishes,8
The Truman Show,cast roundly superb even if majority them minor roles course easy now look back carrey accept he can act straight but time seemed so unlikely few felt good casting choice course seeing end result clear he can he delivers such great performance he really makes film work,8
The Truman Show,he comic but yet serious sympathetic but not worthy pity  great delivery one basically meant i now look his ace ventura stuff other category see his acting his real work 6 years ago vice versa carrey carries film being screen almost entire film but he has good support linney emmerich krause others who play well despite being stuck necessary stiff unreal roles controller etc roles all well played feature collection well known faces including great support role harris through roles giamatti shearer baker hall few others may carreys show but support certainly helps,10
The Truman Show,overall great film can appreciated much what surface great little comic story can issues hints all time there time when some viewers may have looked carrey film load mugging crude basic laughs but film saw change thought provoking funny entertaining short enjoyable well acted throughout  well worth seeing well worth coming back several times,10
The Truman Show,i asked friend describe truman show he said no its not comedy wellnot exactly i didnt quite understand until i watched myself truman takes tone quite different than any parodycomedies ive seen lately point media its destructive powers subtlely relayed through dark humor you dont feel like director smashing you over head his morals peter weir demonstrated his artistic genius dead poets society here well soundtrack great ed harris stellar what were they thinking academy once i actually liked jim carrey his performance wasnt ribald once final scenei will not reveal itis majestic longawaited finish intellectual movie some people will insist boring pointless those same viewers who prefer slapstick obvious humor subtle layers presented here thinking persons movie if you cant see underlying message here course you wont like,8
The Truman Show,ive seen truman show multitude times each time gets better first watching young age roughly 10 years old i never picked up much deeper meaning behind film idea someones whole life being television program simply entertaining now older viewer more experience analyzing books movies i can really pick up satirical meaning behind plot truman plays star 247 television program his entire life broadcasted all world see he raised believe there no real reason try leave his perfect island throughout film we watch truman tries time time again discover truth behind his life he attempts escape struggle he experiences while trying break free artificial world can seen satirical message world trying oppress you although difficult you can escape supported statement made creator truman show he said we accept reality world which we presented its simple several other hidden messages ideas appear throughout film all actors who play roles trumans life indeed fake despite directly lying person whose life immediately affected lie actorsactresses show no emotion truman comparable lack care society has majority its citizens overall truman show filled subliminal messages hidden meanings all which can directly tied back daily life,10
The Truman Show,when i first saw truman show i came out theatre amazed your first clue you watching something different your normal jim carrey movie i love dialogue camera shot performances direction music running time movie there nothing i would do change i came away truman show feeling inspired which goal good filmmaking jim carrey outstanding truman underplaying him not making him too comic too dramatic but giving true sincerity when asked he deserved oscar nomination ed harris has always been good actor but movie hes great actor he plays christof such arrogance bullheadedness you dont know whether hes helping destroying truman he director peter weir deserved their oscar nods,10
The Truman Show,weir who directed great witness uses different camera angles make you feel like youre actually watching truman show not movie he ends before you get tired concept helped carrey harris give immaculate performances andrew niccol script real star movie too because its inventiveness ingenuity overall truman show what i like call true american classic,9
The Truman Show,not so easy jim carrey because nobody takes you seriously after many funny movies even when he absolutely brilliant he proved himself so many times dramas he so great actor,9
The Truman Show,time there no grade script 10 too low maybe 10 would suffice i must agree everything around us we can see only what we capable see but movie gives so many levels many people would see differently all will thrilled movie,10
The Truman Show,people who interested phenomenon big brothera kind tv voyeurism so present today will see ultimate human desire observe somebodys life its beginning without consent person which object observing there nothing special man who watched but we like have mirrors our lives other people who knows why,9
The Truman Show,course next layer ethical do we have right watch somebodys life because we dont talk about rat but human being who doesnt know he watched tv show,10
The Truman Show,if we go further we must ask ourselves what real our life there always some possibility we observed directed guided monitored somebody our life not so authentic we used think,10
The Truman Show,next layer movie talks about freedom personal choice how we want free no matter what other alternatives free love who we want free go free much possible course if we want free if our mind society stop us,8
Irresistible,movie exceptionally well paced written acted its charming funny entertaining story while bringing scary facts about our election system placing blame squarely both partys shoulders if youre concerned about movie having left lean bc john stewart you shouldnt too worried he more concerned w pointing out ridiculousness entire election system how both parties capitalize off then pushing liberal agenda very entertaining educational,9

Dunkirk,brilliant cinematography real planes flying real destruction planes most real possible thats always great films its one nolans best quality director he want real things happening camera course hans zimmer original score also brilliant,7
Dunkirk,nonlinear narrative intelligent mole sequences fell longer good way because characters spend 1 week there sea sequences little bit more faster because characters spend 1 day there air sequences even faster because characters spend 1hour there when 3 got together climax least should thats when nonlinear storytelling gets little messy some sequences third act not puted best way but whole movie so extremely well made his technical stand points written full suspense amazing original score hans zimmer lot peoples dont realize they just dont care,9
Dunkirk,most negative point like i said some scenes dont fit very well nonlinear agitation film especially last half hour nonlinear movie bad but like i said all qualities films has not going ruin experience watch,9
Dunkirk,film also not made most remembered about acting which not necessarily bad thing some peoples also says characters kinda weak which not actually true sure they not strong like characters saving private ryan example but they strong film just dont focus too much them film most interested what happened dunkirk during particular time world war ii all said mark rylance really good movie he has best lines cillian murphy also very good,10
Dunkirk,dunkirk one most visually stunning films 2017 one most realistic depictions tragic events shown cinema,7
Dunkirk,one would think without any proper characterization backstories any characters dunkirk would present itself dull excuse endless action but its exact opposite characters shown us way which we understand them their purpose only glancing them which one best aspects dunkirk however also one worst only minor issue dunkirk i have actors arent given much do which production quality easily outweighs 104minute runtime dunkirk perfectly balances two stories lots action unlike films twice runtime doesnt drag second dunkirk also one best sounding films last few years rightfully so earned itself oscars both sound mixing editing well film editing,5
Dunkirk,dunkirk manages entertaining emotional little no characterisation i would recommend anyone who wants see compelling story just some good action,2
Dunkirk,final score 910,5
Dunkirk,film shows christopher nolan does not only depend crazy action crazy plot twist he shows 3 separate stories come together tells us good story,3
Dunkirk,dunkirk my opinion yet another masterpiece mastermind christopher nolan since everything brilliant about film has already been said i will briefly write what i think film also touch topic some people criticizing movie,6
Dunkirk,fantastically directed film told 3 perspectives non chronologically superbly tackles narrative non linear story doesnt all pull you away intensity events happening screen dont stop 0000 last scene hans zimmer most likely gives one most fitting scores war film ever sometimes there only one note playing followed heartbeat sounds ticking clock while other times massive orchestra interpreting what going screen movie brilliantly projects feeling each every soldier beach audience confusion turmoil fear cinematography breathtaking i felt anxious throughout most run time there no lead film i cant really say anyone stuck out giving brilliant performance because wasnt needed ill explain why,4
Dunkirk,biggest criticisms dunkirk ive heard so far characters lacking depth we arent given anything invested them i feel like nolan trying successfully make audience care each every one men beach he needed have some form main characters story so we can see events unfold direct perspective all soldiers usually war films ill use saving private ryan example plot revolves around certain soldiers like cpt miller ryan being war doing things war but its still about them not war much my opinion dunkirk telling story dunkirk not harry styles character tom hardys character but dunkirk what any main characters felt every other soldier felt nolan resorted more filmmaking techniques tell story rather than dialogue why some people might have had problem lack character depth but realistically type terrible event wouldnt place someone develop character but rather event where men wanted only survival nolan showed perfectly what top review dunkirk imdb says about lack emotion film i believe completely incorrect statement maybe he referring lack brotherhood amongst men feeling moral something epic like again longing saving private ryan format war films what reviewer fails see realistically there no emotion beach besides fear confusion i can safely say nolan zimmer dp all successfully gave us those feelings,6
Dunkirk,9510,3
Dunkirk,might well get right then risk sounding like contrarian i did not love film do i love elements yes 5star masterpiece unfortunately no,1
Dunkirk,cinematography here least masterful director christopher nolan has without doubt reached pinnacle onscreen spectacle here feats practical effects film breathtaking casting nearly 6000 extras authentic wwii vehicles shooting location dunkirk france contribute great sense scale here there ongoing trend action films recent years relying cgi thankfully nolan bucks trend,1
Dunkirk,similar war planet apes much film plays out without much dialogue leaning just score sound design most scenes almost goes without saying hans zimmer delivers another incredible score sound design also extremely well crafted which paired nolans great work behind camera truly transports you battle dunkirk wailing planes passing above drone gunfire roar explosions all contribute complete immersion into world these characters trapped results some most immersive wartime action scenes since saving private ryan,3
Dunkirk,film has will continue compared world war ii classic saving private ryan both films beautifully filmed wwii period pieces casts deliver great performances similarities end there whereas saving private ryan engrossing narrative due its characters depth arcs dunkirk instead leans its subject matter spectacle,3
Dunkirk,while subject matter dunkirk fascinating film lacks emotional firepower due absence strongly written protagonist strangely uncharacteristic director nolans caliber especially when you recall complex character work his most acclaimed films dark knight memento prestige instead focusing single character single group characters focus spread across three protagonists completely different situations showing dunkirk evacuation through three different perspectives those beach sea air only interesting proposition paper narrative due writing choice spread far too thin few characters getting enough screen time develop even mildest emotional connection,1
Dunkirk,while characters film arent written even remotely compelling great work cast not overlooked harry styles known being member english boy band one direction surprisingly excellent here his acting debut mark rylance kenneth branagh fionn whitehead also all give standout performances despite limited screen time they given,3
Dunkirk,i should love film historical drama wwii setting my favorite director christopher nolan amazing cinematography superb performances ensemble cast all these elements made me sure i would love going but dunkirks lack emotional connection severely detracts aweinspiring scope technical prowess displayed,4
Dunkirk,if i reviewed based visuals alone slamdunk walkoff home run 5star film while focus grandeur situation over character depth emotion may work some obviously worked 98 critics rotten tomatoes did not work critic,1
Dunkirk,without doubt cinematic achievement but without emotional core its impossible film not feel cold empty despite being technical masterpiece christopher nolans most disappointing film yet,1
Dunkirk,i very disappointed movie i have liked previous nolan movies but one left me feeling cheated i had spent much money see boring unrealisticone scene had ship getting hit bomb immediately rolling its side then remaining afloatat end plane runs out fuel seemingly defies laws physics gliding forever ever shooting down plane before landing beach they kept showing shots beach lines soldiers nowhere approximated over 400000 soldiers same amount ships boats planes hype being one best war movies ever had me expecting something special instead had me sitting there wondering when fantastic movie going start i waited vain instead i left show headache noise bombardment soundtrackmy biggest sense wonder they had spent much money making i wanted like movie but never happened me,1
Dunkirk,being avid war film fan i beyond excited seeing trailer dunkirk couldnt wait until hit theatres say i disappointed understatement end film i actually mad,10
Dunkirk,i have agree some reviewers here whove stated many these glowing reviews paid because what theyre describing isnt even same film,1
Capone,i admired film more than i enjoyed but kept my interest throughout despite being bit slog times its fascinating title capone invokes expectation biopic famous gangster but isnt all something very different very deliberately so but due title its going confuse disappoint most people which why trank hated he had change original title fonzo marketing reasons theres hardly reference kind film its not traditional narrative any sense,5
Capone,what i keep thinking about how even most gangster films who pretend deglamorize criminals their lifestyle fail its same problem anti war movie still depicts rousing exciting adventure next misery atrocities thus defeats its own purpose rare war gangster film actually achieves show underlying emptiness ugly banal vulgar sad reality ultimately what most lives violence lead towards until haunting memories only thing remains,4
Capone,reason obvious nobody would watch kind film because would too bleak but capone manages rare feat its bleak but not bleak enough turn you off its even often entertaining terms its performances fantastic score beautiful cinematography but even though probably wasnt films intention still manages ultimate deconstruction gangster icon more so even than scorseses irishman though its nowhere near good film,6
Capone,i liked capone its weird i guess you shouldnt watch unless you like profoundly weird little arthouse films but definitely not badly made film i hope trank continues path makes more strange personal films although perhaps kind little more accessible,4
Capone,can tom hardy just finish season 2 taboo already waste his time talent,1
Capone,i love gangster movies i am big fan tom hardy ok so i had every reason universe anticipate movie aaand you can see my rating i didnt like main reason boring aimless boring,4
Capone,i m only writing review praise tom hardy who per usual gave his 100 disappeared role capone hes brightest star pile well you get,7
Capone,check movie his performance if you have patience if not i dont know go watch boardwalk empire 00,3
Capone,greetings again darkness i really hoping josh trank resurgence when his fantastic four became one worst reviewed movies 2015 he lost out chance direct star wars film given creative control writerdirectoreditor capone supposed his chance bounce back recapture intrigue promise his first film chronicle 2011 he even chose fascinating notorious gangster al capone subject his comeback what could go wrong well most everything,8
Capone,tom hardy usually adds enough interest make any his projects entertaining watch sometimes hes downright brilliant going back bronson 2008 through tinker tailor soldier spy 2011 warrior 2011 dark knight rises 2012 mad max fury road 2015 revenant 2015 tvs peaky blinders mr hardy has quite resume memorable characters above list barely covers half time out he plays al capone fonse dont dare call him al house he has recently been released alcatraz where he serving his sentence tax evasion confined his florida mansion capone only 47 years old but looks twenty years older thanks effects neurosyphillisinduced dementia his mind never clear his visions take him back his violent criminal past snapshots his youth everpresent gold balloon,5
Capone,we cant really tell if filmmaker trank meant parody not capone seen mumbling nearzombie almost always wearing bathrobe his eyes bloodshot once menacing gangster now paranoid saggy diaperwearing shell who noisily chomps cigar carrot fires off his goldplated tommy gun has constant issues vomitbladderbowels typically parody offers either slapstick black comedy but i only recall single chuckle one occurs when capone pulls out shotgun while fishing boat his old mob buddy johnny matt dillon other than its mostly bleak look dementia lost power man who follows his visions into closets basements jumps up during movie singalong cowardly lions if i were king forest,8
Capone,supporting players given little work great linda cardellini plays mae capones supportive wife while kyle maclachlan his crooked doctor noel fisher al junior al sapienza capones brother ralphie kathrine narducci ralphies wife there secondary plot point involving government surveillance they attempt discover whereabouts 10 million capone supposedly stashed years ago course capone doesnt remember when fbi agent jack lowden director trank cameo interrogates him hes unsure whether capone acting actually far gone there also bit about phone calls tony possibly longlost capone son borne affair,5
Capone,film covers capones final year mostly comes across sad depressing view dementia most obvious statement capones loss power comes form metaphor his beloved lady atlas garden statue removed sold off there also recurring moment where capone tunes radio broadcast saint valentines day massacre family time thanksgiving nothing short painful watch cinematographer peter deming mulholland drive 2001 gives us well shot film but despite couple david lynchtype moments film mostly lacks entertainment value i cant figure out who might want watch trank seemed go deeply artistic route subject thats tough watch maybe hell get yet another shot,2
Capone,available vod beginning may 12 2020,1
Capone,beautifully shot movie thats only plus wasted cast terrible script incoherent slow all hell,7
Capone,i created imdb account just write review really bad,8
Capone,tom hardy gives good performance even his voice been strange but putting fact character suffering dementia i dont know al capone real voice i can forgive voice thing if you ever saw person dementia similar disease you known they dont sound normally,7
Capone,linda cardellini also gives good performance showing how much she suffering whatching her husband going through all weight she carrying stand there him,1
Capone,there also some good sequences makes you go deep into insanity capones mind which also congratulation hardy but rest history characters very very empty,1
Capone,only good acting not gonna make good movie,9
Capone,biopic safe hollywood bet studios producers filmmakers love take historical figure andor someone well known cast wellliked dramatic actor fill script typical beats rising up mediocrity poverty show their struggle talent their triumphs moments where they become who we know them then their downfall their age,9
Capone,tried true formula movie industry loves every year theres least one these usually about music artists but also sometimes about athletes other outstanding pop culture figures some cases criminals capone tom hardy directed josh trank follows none these familiar beats doesnt play any these wellworn expectations,9
Capone,i think one reasons movie has so many low ratings due viewers who love godfather scarface goodfellas long line classics gangster subgenre having their expectations subverted when they encountered slower paced methodical sad strangely comedic offbeat portrayal feared member americas criminal underworld his lowest point desperately trying hang man he used while suffering ravages syphilis,8
Capone,lot people love see gangsters get away crime rise power see film glamorizes life crime thats not what you get here maybe misadvertised but i saw performance tom hardy captured pain frustration being trapped body thats betraying you all while surrounded people youre not sure you can trust memories past turning pleasant nightmarish space second,5

X-Men: Dark Phoenix,acting utterly bad good actors had no script act sophie turner had no talent act music utterly nonsensical hans dear stop falling asleep keyboard while composing same score stretched continuously half movie then slightly different score playing continuously other half dialogue stuttered all them camera angles lots closeups tried give illusion emotional weight but failed miserably whole movie felt like looooong bad dream like spawn someone who messed up his brain some wd then got into directors writers chair,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,applauses simon k destroying such wonderful franchise,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,dont know where start if youre going dig up greatest story xmen canon you need bring film brought nothing all felt so hollow characters didnt ring true story didnt ring true all over place many nonsensical choices throughout i so excited my favorite storyline disappointed more than i can put into words political social propaganda piece missed mark miles,2
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,movie disaster starting main character jean acting sooo bland colorless amateurlike i dont understand how she got such big role also seemed like everyone movie aware her limited acting skills so they barely gave her any lines she sleepingpassed out quite some time moviejust watch movie her acting basically screams clueless,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,then like any recent movies they felt need include gender politics why why there need line says we should called xwomen ever part comics i didnt read them but i highly doubt just so pathetic forced political agendas should not forced into movies,8
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,if wasnt james mcavoy michael fassbender i wouldve left cinema very early,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,all all movie joke i will make sure exclude whenever i go xmen marathon future,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,sophie turner seems like wonderful person but acting just isnt her thing she barely pulled off sanaa got giving her lead here just mistake,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,she has no charisma i dont identify her character which best thing one main protagonists just dont care about her,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,movie also mess seems like editing made worse me i just couldnt get behand protagonist all wasnt invested,7
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,what waste talent lister stars play like supporting roles sophie turner just simply not workout shes just like wooden stick flat boring about raven also not make any sense so why should we care about all characters all then story line seems rushing all way 2019 so i think director insulting audiences intelligent i felt sad angry after film finished,4
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,i love xmen i watched every single one past 20 years multiple times while i did enjoy some more than others i never hated any film i closed my eyes small mistakes forgave them anything not time,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,instead going out strong leaving good impression after so many years they did exact opposite movie distorted rushed predictable flat overall unimpressive everything looks cheap costumes decorations actors uninterested movie look like they just want deliver their weak lines get done soon possible nobody fox cared about movie so why should we i am sad what done my beloved franchise,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,moviesshmovies,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,i dont understand why would you choose adapt comics book any existing writing movie if you cant even respect essence original story why rewriting entire story your taste case writer obviously confuse version xmen found twilight zone i am fan purist i owned entire collection xmen sub publications am choked last version xmen saga when you have so much material your disposal write real scenario movie disaster lets say clearly so bad story line acting special effects toit doesnt reach level scifi b movie wishing i could give negative rate,1
X-Men: Dark Phoenix,i remembering xmen 3 same movie however one so much worse no real story line music did not fit story felt if everyone just wanted get movie over x men 3 did not leave me feeling like i love x men so disappointing see good actors working such terrible story,1
A Simple Favor,i really liked film plot well actorsthe casting story develops well has both fun exciting moments during first three quarters films length but film totally loses end ending completely implausible chaotic unfortunately problem many hollywood movies how get good ending,6
A Simple Favor,so i will only partially recommend title,6
A Simple Favor,movie quite enjoyable longest time well paced well acted mostly then conclusion happened like seriously what where they thinking,7
A Simple Favor,not only bad i guess thats just opinion but still also lot worse written paced acted than rest movie up point where only explanation producers someone wanted ending changed movie would have been lot better if just ended half hour earlier ending one worst i have seen years,8
A Simple Favor,simple favour catch b recent times its rare watch two genres getting mushed into one still work simple favour took thriller genre added comedy very subtle way i believe work works better because perfect casting anna kendrick blake lively both girls nailed part their chemistry palpable,6

A Simple Favor,my wife i were pleasantly surprised gem two lead actresses did great job first half movie kept you engaged second half dragged bit but overall very good film,9
A Simple Favor,well worth your time gives constant misdirection coming person can predict entire movies plot including twists first 17 minutes screen movie challenge confidently pin down its path,6
A Simple Favor,writing brilliant actors brought vivid narrative satisfying reality each character well used no loose ends left their purpose like your favorite dickinson novel comedy delivered sharply savage one liner witty quip accompanying almost every role,3
A Simple Favor,conclusion isnt spoon fed mediocrity like many reviews wanting but rather triple turn around summersault nose dive crescendo its well worth setting up rest film even though its not strongest part but thats credit expectation rest movie sets,7
A Simple Favor,i may hyping movie up but its fantastic watch especially if youre into mysteries if you dig stuff like gone girl but light hearted tone youll love,3

A Simple Favor,stephanie emily share dark personal secrets emily discusses financial woes she her husband sean henry golding crazy rich asians experiencing even though they live ultramodern mansion he had success his first novel but has been hit writers block since marrying emily those secrets pale comparison what stephanie unloads leading emily anoint her crass though quite accurate label no one would relish course we later uncover emilys truly dark deadly secrets go far beyond possible late payments mortgage,8
A Simple Favor,two ladies bond we get feeling emily playing some type game alwayscheerful stephanie though what end we arent sure one day stephanie does emily favor then emily disappears without trace word days pass sexual energy develops between stephanie sean while stephanie users her vlog tool her amateur sleuthing,1
A Simple Favor,its tough enough pull off mystery but mysterycomedy nearly unicorn cinema director feig his best comedic moments especially those featuring banter between ms kendrick ms lively their scenes together highlights film well those french pop soundtrack including ca sest arrange over opening credit sequence itself worthy admission film oddly structured yet still entertaining act i really dark comedy budding friendship between polar opposite personality types while rest messy mystery some interesting elements,1
A Simple Favor,strong support work comes courtesy andrew rannells aparla nancherla kelly mccormack jean smart though two standouts rupert friend homeland emilys boss character seemingly straight out zoolander linda cardellini bloodlines unhinged artist tied emilys past downside most these scenes add comedysketch feel which clashes so harshly mystery element sharp edge needed script becomes quite dulled,1
A Simple Favor,most every director dreams being hitchcockian dream tends push them towards genre unfortunately most end up disappointed their films end up disappointing genius difficulty what hitchcock achieved reinforced its clear director feig fan genre he includes nods diaboliqe gaslight double indemnity even nancy drew however acknowledging classic noir isnt enough qualify label film has its moments ms kendrick once again stellar her role most viewers will find entertaining despite messiness,7

Ready Player One,ive noticed quite few reviews here book fans complaining movie wasnt true novel fan book let me just say thats true but its fine overarching story same fact matter nearly 400 page novel packed full pop culture references some things would have cut make onto big screen partially its issue length partially its just reality planets were never going fully align allow use many properties novel yes i loved 2112 wargames dd joust et al references novel much next person but still i felt spielberg captured wonder fun story novel accurately even if he did so using different references actually some things i even think were improvement book especially way they reimagined ir0k bottom line if youre book reader just take movie what alternate version story written same person who wrote novel,8
Ready Player One,ready player one inoffensive enough entertaining but gets bit stupid when thought put into,6
Ready Player One,ready player one very fun movie very experienced steven spielberg behind visually its stunning full glaring moments spielbergesque choreography sound musical score too done similarly adding aesthetic pleasure film,9
Ready Player One,when ready player one starts go downhill first major issue spoonfed pop culture references especially 80s todays adolescent audience film thrives them starts getting overwhelming annoying after few,9
Ready Player One,second issue how much watered down film book all sticking points book completely ignored making books relatively dark narrative feel soft film which almost insulting book,8
Ready Player One,final major issue illogicality plot how one kid able find all answers oasis but whole company man women working together isnt,7
Ready Player One,besides film being stupid illogical still manages mostly fun start finish worth some praise its vigorous visuals,3
Ready Player One,final grade 610,10
Ready Player One,there seem two camps far ready player one concerned those who have read books who tend dislike movie those who havent who tend like movie im latter group am very thankful,4
Ready Player One,when trailer came out i unimpressed didnt get onboard hype all yes i impressed all pop culture references characters but i figured would all flash no substance,4
Ready Player One,thankfully i couldnt have been anymore wrong read player one has plenty substance emotion charm i thoroughly enjoyed every minute,3
Ready Player One,set near dystopian world where people use virtual reality world called oasis escape their lives tells story one player his efforts participating competition decide fate entire universe oasis,6
Ready Player One,plot if fantastic very well handled movie looks like billion dollars cast did decent enough job pop culture references though thick fast didnt overwhelm movie like i feared they would,2
Ready Player One,overwatchs tracer streetfighters chunli ryu teenage mutant ninja turtles iron giant chucky freddy kreuger mortal kombats goro gundam mechgodzilla king kong countless more i being big olnerd really appreciated combined incredible mostly 80s soundtrack its sight behold,2

Taxi Driver,towering classic american cinematic power martin scorsese teams up one most intense actors time create masterpiece urban alienation paul schraders magnificent script paints portrait loneliness largest city world travis never once enters into meaningful relationship any character anywhere film he most hopelessly alone person ive ever encountered film,10
Taxi Driver,he alone his thoughts his thoughts dark ones film fools you first viewing travis endearing eccentric sure hes odd but hes so polite hes got quirky sense humor his affection betsy actually rather endearing but second view you see what audience comes see traviss psychosis gradually but theres actually far less development than one might think when he talks about cleaning up city repeat viewer knows he doesnt mean some sort giulianifacelift less film about character development kind snapshot sure takes stimulus provoke response but does imply some kind central change character,10
Taxi Driver,tremendous supporting roles brought life through vivid performances keitel foster especially shepards character betsy little more than foil highlight traviss utter alienation society but she still impeccably portrayed only two scenes dont center travis unavoidably de niros show life which supporting cast imbues their characters credit themselves directors willingness let film develop intersection diverse ideas approaches what would plot lose eliminating albert brooks character tom nothing all he makes almost no impact traviss life which where plot lives but his inclusion makes film whole much richer fuller,10
Taxi Driver,piece american cinema history film will live forever but far more important than film will survive universal everrelevant examination workings alienated mind story doesnt end when credits roll we know travis will snap again but story doesnt end travis either continues today cities schools film about brutal power disaffected mind,10
Taxi Driver,film didnt cause incidents colombine hawaii seattle wherever you care look even all its disturbing images violence didnt cause those things predicted them,10
Taxi Driver,script taxi driver built like diary diary very ordinary guy who gets hired night taxi driver back vietnam because he cant sleep night very ordinary guy who tries break his isolation but cant while violence accumulates inside him one those unnoticed people dark things their mind one those who break up news one day some extraordinary outburst rage fall back immediately into anonymity,10
Taxi Driver,gradual transformation man into beast movie chilling its still funny pathetic when hero threatens himself front mirror youre talking me but when he comes out mohawk hairdo dark glasses obvious nasty stuff going take place clockwork orange violence recuperated society depending what purpose used whereas he about murder candidate presidency gods lonely man fails instead kills vicious pimp who exploits teenage prostitutes potential criminal becomes hero day,6
Taxi Driver,such stories happen everywhere course but seems bewildering atmosphere new york citys summer night best choice taxi driver gives us very realistic approach new york way not seen screen so often least not anymore whilst city probably one world has been filmed biggest number times,9
Taxi Driver,most movie takes place night credits open blazing lights yellow taxi cab moving slowly dark rainy streets kaleidoscope neonlight appears through dripping windows drivers eyes blink front mirror night heros universe its time when all animals come out he says contrast few daylight scenes look somewhat offkey but definitely intentional,6
Taxi Driver,final scene still appears today extremely violent but least shows murder what brutal ugly crude something one tends forget about after seeing so many police series where people get shot so often gets casual real violence not casual when you face here film makes you face,9
Taxi Driver,directing first class deservedly made path scorsese world renowned artist some techniques he used here unusual american cinema like focusing details few seconds movie enhanced excellent music soundtrack jazz composer bernard herrman who died before picture even released,8
Taxi Driver,two actors also deservedly made stardom robert de niro plays very unglamorous character but his presence screen so intense its no wonder made such impression jodie foster she already appeared films child but playing teenage prostitute certainly not easy challenge probably role really turned her into major actress,10
Taxi Driver,taxi driver big hit when came out both public critics won palme dor cannes served trend setter many later films like instance quentin tarantinos abel ferraras but even today original model seems difficult emulate probably because achieving masterpiece rare thing definition,1
Taxi Driver,taxi driver classic made robert deniro robert deniro its amazing see how far man has come cinema some my friends ask me questions about films advice one my friends had asked if they wanted see where bobby got big notice i usually recommend taxi driver granted he godfather part 2 incredible but taxi driver made him stand out strong lead actor taxi driver just all together great film absolutely perfection martin scorcesse who also just really starting out made movie brought us back film noir genre he made great classic i dont even think he realized how much would stand against test time day we still know film even if you dont know you know infamous speech you talking me film about isolation loneliness self destruction its worst,10
Taxi Driver,travis bickle who claims honorably discharged marine implied he vietnam veteran lonely depressed young man 26 he settles manhattan where he becomes night time taxi driver due chronic insomnia bickle spends his restless days seedy porn theaters works 12 14 hour shifts during evening night time hours carrying passengers among all five boroughs new york city bickle becomes interested betsy campaign volunteer new york senator charles palantine she initially intrigued bickle agrees date him after he flirts her over coffee sympathizes her own apparent loneliness their date however bickle clueless about how treat woman thinks would good idea take her sex film offended she leaves him takes taxi home alone next day he tries reconcile betsy phoning her sending her flowers but all his attempts vain rejected depressed bickles thoughts begin turn violent disgusted petty street crime he witnesses while driving through city he now finds focus his frustration begins program intense physical training he buys number pistols illegal dealer practices menacing speech mirror while pulling out pistol he attached homemade sliding action holster his right arm you talking me bickle revolted what he considers moral decay around him one night while shift iris 12yearold child prostitute gets his cab attempting escape her pimp shocked occurrence bickle fails drive off pimp sport reaches cab later seeing iris street he pays her time although he does not have sex her instead tries convince her leave way life behind but after her rejection well travis decides take things into his own hands pow,3
Taxi Driver,one most memorable movies all time has really stood its ground its personally one my favorites made me fall love robert deniro all over again script taxi driver just so incredibly powerful performances were just perfect jodie foster little girl time such presence screen she pulls what very tricky performance hauntingly beautiful cybill sheppard also very beautiful i absolutely love her character felt so bad her everything about taxi driver just great i dont know how much i could go about love i have film its film you will never forget trust me if you havent seen go out rent immediately you wont regret its bloody its twisted its crazy but its one best films all time,10
Taxi Driver,10oct,4
Taxi Driver,travis bickle vietnam veteran who cannot sleep night just ends up travelling around try use time effectively he becomes taxi driver things start look up him he works nights slowly starts live little bit he meets girl betsy arranges see her few times despite fact he little bit out ordinary  quality seems interest her his connection night allows him see young prostitute iris being bullied her pimp matthew he begins see his role perhaps save her  him playing his part cleaning up sewer he feels new york has become however when his view normal life puts betsy off him he starts retreat more more into night looking meaning his life growing more more outraged world he part,1
Taxi Driver,hardly most uplifting films engaging impressive truly deserves reputation has martin scorsese paul schrader have produced film convincingly portrays man cut out society who has slightest connection normality before finding eroded away script brilliant because detail engaging but descent into very modern type madness drives film forward travis has just enough about him recognisable makes so easy go along rest his madness major part getting feeling right about living cesspit city seems have forgotten its way morally  new york strongest example but elements could parts any city i suspect painting world such real way scorsese has made travis all more convincing point all easier follow his fall like i said not film morally uplift you but one depressingly fair there no redemption modern world although appears violence end somehow redeems travis reality showing society accepting his action drags rest us down nearer world he hates has become part i love king comedy same reason albeit different world,10
Taxi Driver,scorsese injects real understanding place real sense foreboding into even earliest scenes he inserts clever meaningful shots into scenes other directors might just have filmed straight his choice scene shot compliments script depicting travis descending into madness what makes film even better de niro showing type form makes his recent form such major disappointment he outstanding he moves travis being relatively normal being eaten up inside out his eventual implosion impressive but only impressive gradual slide he depicts over course film although he dominates others impress well foster stands out small role while keitel makes good impression pimp shepherd not quite good but her character not well written others so isnt all down her regardless film belongs de niro although quotable scenes ones remembered quieter moments where he excels shows genuine talent understanding,1
Taxi Driver,overall impressive morally depressing film deserves its place cinematic history portrayal city man slipping into moral insanity convincing engaging shows how well do modern madness effects moral void parts society scorsese directs master despite being early stage his career de niro chillingly effective he simply dominates film quiet moments quotable moments alike i rarely use phrases like modern classic because i think they lazy but one film certainly deserves such label,5
The Vast of Night,i able see vast night tiff midnight madness did not disappoint film takes story small town alien abduction theme carries out story precisely way you would expect but its genius comes how audience taken through twilight zone esque story done fantastic performances small cast some best cinematography i have ever seen all carried out vision director patterson three acts carried out seemingly 3 shots some scenes lasting over 10 minutes time operation set up 1950s switchboards film reel taking up much action allowed me focus scenes primarily my ears after few minutes action became secondary dialogue so much so could work almost well radio play does feature film when camera does move flow takes us literally seamlessly travel across town back again which allows us audience feel like we truly bearing witness one thrilling evening very very small town certain points film i begging camera cut however desperate see actions even movement another character scene instead one angle but thats what ultimately gave its charm felt like sitting living room listening story our eyes,9
The Vast of Night,scifi thriller has feeling old twilight zone episode story but revitalized incredible performances direction cinematography allows carve out its own unique place eery charming,8
The Vast of Night,call me weird one but movie trippy watching story go out drone photography blackouts black white color fascinating director made work acting intriguing watching teenage girl scurry place place all charm trusting small town wellit i loved very unique,9
The Vast of Night,one most remarkable film these years vast night sincerely proves tiny powerful subject movies could still improve give goosebumps made suspence good direction addictive acting amazing plot just intentionally word pun classic modern,8
The Vast of Night,me near perfect film although its subject matter little interest me everything else score lighting editing magnificent performances were beautiful best seen while film so much mood i mesmerized after initial 5 annoying minutes transfixed till very end go see little gem,9
The Vast of Night,just yesterdays evening i turned yet another page my journey through rod serlings twilight zone even though i anticipating vast night i did not predict so pleasantly thickly atmospheric beautiful just plain awesome well inspired everything thats twilightzoneesque so fans such vibes assemble because we got unlikely modern gem our hands,8
The Vast of Night,things thatll follow impressive become even more impressive light fact vast night very first voyage into cinema its director andrew patterson both writers james montague craig w sanger three names look forward future cast quite unknown well budget micro allegedly pulled together director foreground these factors already welloiled lofi modern scifi classicinmaking glows even more brightly,5
The Vast of Night,first couple minutes movie makes known its served if episode fictional 50s scifi fantasy tv show called paradox theather obvious acknowledged twilight zone knockoff first act we spend following lively lovely main characters through their small home town cayuga another nod rod serling they local radio dj everett jake horowitz young switchboard operator fay sierra mccormick quickly enough we see feel many qualities vast night thatll stay us till end one them setting 50s which fulfilled great attention detail both visually mentally its time where small towns seemed more intimate unified when future seemed like endless uncertain stream farreaching possibilities another point great charm cinematography perhaps one my favorite examples art long time there many long takes some mostly static some moving onetakes one which might prompt silent whoa longest take i believe about 9 half minutes long cinematographer m i littinmentz hands stone resistance has made camera presence sorts force intimacy uneasiness regards editing there some choices might prompt some whys but theres nothing thatd really take away take out much anything sum elements come out far positive side providing atmosphere immerses youll citizen cayuga before you know,5
The Vast of Night,main story kicks into gear start second act both our heroes encounter eerie radio signal floating local waves start trying unspool slow descending mystery vast night pays homage multiple scifi horror classics yet constantly feels original inventive its own somehow mixing together sticky sweet feeling nostalgia breath fresh creativity originality letting latter lead show all times same can said about haunting original score composed erick alexander jared bulmer whom also very first endeavor movies movie most part essentially talking piece overall idea ominous ambiguous youd probably guess so action scifi fans lovers structured concluded stories might find themselves frustrated,8
The Vast of Night,props also have given previously mentioned jake horowitz sierra mccormick vast night jakes very first full feature acting debut id never guessed while watching movie both he sierra do terrific job their roles carry nights vibes admirable synchronicity im not guy know but i felt like even accents language way talking 50s generally nailed,7
The Vast of Night,its one those movies where its better go blind yet i believe its healthy estimate what not expect so weve got out way credits were rolling i found myself happily thinking sense wonder still exists there secrets uncover creativity well some forgotten amazing vibes alive well my rating 810,4
The Vast of Night,i really love film way shot characters care very real mostly so simple no crash bang wallop they just build up feeling its very good tim,4
The Vast of Night,i gave movie 810 because its story kind reminds me being child being read bedtime story something fun wonderful fanciful scary mysterious adventurous fill your head wipe out drama day i imagine what people wont like lack concrete ending but thats them i encourage folks stop watching movies complete account something when its done its done wheres magic i love movies books end such way your imagination can take off continue play out many different ways sense becomes never ending story good fun way we live daily drama reality why sam hill would you want watch more movies tv should escape reality such i found movie nostalgic exciting fun mysterious well scripted well acted,4

The Vast of Night,why i really disappointed i didnt enjoy more,4
The Vast of Night,i think could have been vastly improved if just tightened up little bit i know only hour 30 long which shocked my when i saw because felt like nearly 2 hours scenes kind meander along sluggish pace nothing rally happening first 20 minutes movie walk home school i am not exaggerating just them leaving school walking home 20 minutes now i will say they try keep interesting shots dialogue fine but doesnt take away fact its too long such simple scene i guess you could argue used set characters up but i got first like 3 minutes meeting them,2
The Vast of Night,i honestly think would have been better 2030 minute episode twilight zone even 2019 version because there good idea somewhere movie moments had me intrigued i wanted know what going then you would hit nothing happening again i understand budget wasnt lot probably contributes they didnt have much sets locations,4
The Vast of Night,actors did good job they had lot work do like 90 movie just them talking sometimes no one else room so i think they did good job,10
The Vast of Night,only reason i think you should watch because there good ideas here i think writerdirecter could make great films future i think he did best he could budget just bare mind can drag,3
The Vast of Night,ill concede im not unapologetic scifi buff but other than some good acting movie simply cliche 50s ufo sighting story nothing grabbed me all i kept waiting something interesting happen never did,3

Rambo: Last Blood,dark brutal graphic extreme some words i would use sum movie up pretty standard story but does take us some unexpected dark places sly does what he does best strong silent brooding role big winner here action we come expect final climatic battle very violent graphic but executed very very well,7
Rambo: Last Blood,rating 9010 truly amazing rambo last blood sylvester stallone very talented actor no one could ever touch character john rambo way he did i wish after he come out retirement can remind new generation what he have done rambo last blood grounded drama action must see all you go see bloody good time,9
Rambo: Last Blood,i saw some reviews movie one particular critic called laughable trumpian fantasy i doubt they ever actually watched movie just fashionably offended looking something complain about movie action masterpiece,10
Rambo: Last Blood,formulaic yes but sheer grit psychotic rage emanated john rambo film step above what we have seen him past its culmination every injustice every disappointment every cauterized bullet wound channelled into revenge one too many unwanted grievance camels back has broken blood will pour through flood gates if its action revenge thriller you want exactly what you will get film 1010,10
Rambo: Last Blood,growing up watching rambo movies 80s many times over i excited when rambo returned 2008 very emotional movie rambo angrier more brutal than ever box office success film ive patiently waited 5th installment here finally i decided last minute go see thing its opening night theater nearly 70 percent full everyone anticipation what will probably last chapter john rambo saga its different rambo film no police pushing rambo out town no russians vietnamese tangle rambo really really just wants live clam life perhaps he always wanted guy even medication help him stay cool but there evil darkness wishes torment already tormented soul soul john rambo he seems really content his new life his adopted family he has beautiful young girl his life who calls him uncle john lovingly all honesty i wouldnt have minded complete film relationship building people his life just john farm his family raising young girl seeing her grow into young lady will soon off college rambo very proud her protecting but she has demon her past too its her father has left her moved back mexico most children have been abandoned their paternal parents she yearns see her father ask him one question eats her alive why did you leave my mother i question she soon regrets she ever traveled all way mexico ask her father doing so she has betrayed her families trust but rambo loves her becomes hell bent save her cartels without giving too much away when rambo finally sees her again save her bittersweet he has invested his last ten years into young girl see what happens her real life happens so many human trafficking victims pull tears your heart strings when you wipe away tears you find completely unhinged rambo takes out bad guys rage like no other bare hand bashing hammers used break skulls shotgun blasts decapitations knives just about every part human body you can imagine how hell stallone keeps action sequences so fresh after nearly 40 years beyond me there moments redundancy film yes but not overly action film complete 10 go blood bath ecstacy get ready hold one hell action packed ride,9

Rambo: Last Blood,i felt compelled write review after reading backlash movie has received being racist unnecessarily violent im mexican i saw movie cinema obviously filled mexicans no one felt offended everyone cheering towards end final montage hit feelings note perfectly rambo character embedded deeply mexican pop culture well many other countries hurts me say but villains you see movie reality happens my country if anything i congratulate stallone denouncing criminal activity its not perfect movie does have different feeling than other ones but when rambo finally appears youll feel his most cold blooded self he can violence while gruesome i didnt feel unnecesary especially if you know how criminal bands operate so go cinema enjoy movie what feel secure south border we ohh so happy have another rambo movie no one feeling offended,7
Rambo: Last Blood,rambo last blood 2019,9
Rambo: Last Blood,73 most people prefer sit home relax reminisce their youth while being surrounded their family sylvester stallone not built way year he made movie prove action stars 80s simply dont age obviously he has lost step two not flying around screen like he used but bloody 73 he still one man army living proof age just number,10
Rambo: Last Blood,rambo last blood no nonsense grim action movie cliche plot does not pretend bigger than nobody saving world mass enslavement spies nuclear threats simple revenge thriller loads action grit violence can easily rival john wick terms creativity stallone lone wolf who still has sharp fangs despite his gray hair his enemies will find out just how sharp these fangs,8
Rambo: Last Blood,very similar previous rambo films just smaller scale so goes without saying if you fan franchise 8090s action stallone general then you will feel right home fast pace simple narrative grim settings plently violence give last blood genuine throwback feel golden days action,8
Rambo: Last Blood,moviesshmovies instagram,10
Rambo: Last Blood,so i must admit i didnt have very high hopes going see movie idea man his 70s playing kind character combined critics scores which moment appalling low made me think would not turn out good film i very wrong i am happy say,9
Rambo: Last Blood,just like first movie series movie has very important lesson embedded very gritty entertaining story i dont wish include spoilers review so i will just say regard story revolves around naivety youth brought up secure environment just not understanding brutality real world consequences can have,8
Rambo: Last Blood,movie fairly gory which not normally my thing but context story looking highlight brutal realities has important part play really bringing home viewer,5
Rambo: Last Blood,i have say great all round movie if indeed final chapter rambo character i think really went out bang i strongly recommend going view,4
Rambo: Last Blood,great comeback after long break rambo series only gets better definitely worth wait,10
Rambo: Last Blood,ok so i have admit i cant help but love sly stallone guy just keeps coming back succesfully against all odds who would have thought he could pull off another rambo flick age 73 well im glad he did because besides liam neeson denzel washington mel gibson who we gonna turn some old school oldmanonarevengespree flick,10
Rambo: Last Blood,i big fan first blood but didnt care so much second too cartoonish third too friggin awful installments fourth however just amazing slow build up suspenseful breakout then cathartic violence last action sequence where rambo goes totally berserk makes minced meat out whole army i mean come awesome,4
Rambo: Last Blood,fifth rambo little different more generic revenge flick its setup but only its setup though soon rambo starts maiming killing movie goes so far over top you cant help but cheer him one bloody movie last blood may but many full bucket,10
Rambo: Last Blood,i also like how rambo more vulnarable flick stallone gets use more his acting chops one,4
Rambo: Last Blood,i know its lot ask maybe i shouldnt even hope but damn i sure would like another one these,10
Rambo: Last Blood,dont listen critics if youre fan rambo youre gonna enjoy lot its not best franchise but still very enjoyable without giving away spoilers heres brief summary story rambos niece kidnapped mexican drug cartels up rambo find her so do yourself favour go see film,1
Rambo: Last Blood,rambo last blood last movie rambo franchise o my god its amazing its logan 2017 rambo series i very impressed everything about movie best film rambo franchise since first blood curiously titled rambo last blood injects heart back into legendary action franchise before ripping out aweinspiring avalanche violence reestablishes sylvester stallone action hero equal if screen kills art what last blood delivers masterpiece deluge bloody ferocious brutality delivered trademark sly snarl thankfully shakycam free violence last blood more than matches recent output other oneman army movies,8
Rambo: Last Blood,suitably excessive execution wince inducing its means its kind action filmmaking hardcore fans would especially appreciate much like creed films rambo last blood successfully replicates heart spirit how its franchise operates best level john j rambo back cinematic killing floor his domain,10
Fifty Shades of Grey,movie atrocious beyond words first movie which ive ever walked out hour 17 minutes into session full giggling middleaged women wetting themselves anticipation i cannot believe book movie has appeal women really so bored so desperate what gets them off acting appalling i guess thats end ms johnson mr dornans careers i wouldnt surprised if actors who refused role christian grey secretly relieved they had sense reject script laughable no chemistry between two leads eroticismit completely lacking stilted awkward poor cinematography cheesy scripting just terrible,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,do not waste your time money,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,fifty shades grey based badly written book so why someone thought they could make decent film out beyond me actually i dont think anyone believed they could make good film producers just wanted money would come all people who reasons known only themselves read book,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,i had free ticket i had go order do story bottom line im not doing story,2
Fifty Shades of Grey,okay heres problem what breaks my heart we no longer know what good great i am no follower ayn rand but fountainhead she predicted rise mediocrity mediocrity being considered great norm we shoot only stands reason point some things cant even rise sad level isnt mediocre its pathetic i cant believe there people complimenting actors but then i can because they have come accept mediocrity something i fight against all my heart,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,there one other problem book sucked order like one had use his her imagination success book lay fantasy aspect sometimes imagination more powerful than just about anything can give you erotic experience film doesnt fulfill most inane imagination let alone someone who really has wild creative one only fantasy can give you how fast you can get out theater,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,there were people around me laughing ones who werent left what i found out lobby actually demanded got their money back when last time you saw people leaving movie middle im not sure ive ever seen ill guess ive been going movies longer than lot you,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,i lament loss artistic soul creativity going best i miss days when billy wilder writer filmmaker what we left but horrible book written first grade level resulting bad movie,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,i dont want spoil lot so ill just give ratings brief description certain elements socalled film,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,acting 310 acting misplaced awkward not look least convince us youre intense guy mr grey,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,plot 110 wasnt plot normal movie plot softcore porn which had terrible acting real porn,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,camera worksceneryetc 710 what great camera work i guess good scenery,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,romance 210 ive seen notebook thats romance poor attempt romance tries tell you theyre madly love but its just weird sexual relationship,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,drama 110 there no thrill no intense things going there no drama softcoreeroticdrama,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,deeds 1010 they did so cant give any lower points than,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,overall its horrible acted plotless nonromantic nor drama movie about girl being horny guy doing attempt bdsm which comes down softcore almost nothing different than normal sex bondage boring sht,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,note go watch kings man secret service thats one best action movies ive seen while,5
Fifty Shades of Grey,well i thought i would see what all fuss about boy did i wish i hadnt i have seen very bad romantic comedies better than film,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,okay so i have not read book being male i went one my female friends who had read book she said she had enjoyed although having said she had read number years ago,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,we paid our money we took our seats film began i have say wooden acting cruddy screenplay corny dialogue ridiculous script highly improbable storyline were all just too much us not just us seems we could hear titters audience large well coming dialogue within story were supposed serious scenes so not just us i hasten add,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,we gave half hour then i leaned over my friend said do you think theres any chance they will give us our money back what do you think thank god she replied oh thank heavens you said i cant stand another minute lets just get outta here its just terrible,7
Fifty Shades of Grey,we got our money back we complained nothing like book we demanded refund had only seen half hour movie hey presto they refunded my credit card no questions asked,1
Fifty Shades of Grey,i give rubbish 1 star pretty outdoor scenery,10
Fifty Shades of Grey,dont waste your time hollywood its worst,9
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,its unfortunate so much book needed cut time movie still nearly 2 12 hours long rule movie editing when you must trim time you remove subplots lot story character development isnt there,8
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,but what there great visual treat if movie leaves you questions just read book get audio version cd would have taken minimum another half hour flesh movie out simply wasnt going done studio whose primary target younger audience note how no studio wants release animated film longer than 90 minutes reason perhaps alphonso curon would have done better job cohesion but there really isnt much more could have been done time script would have been essentially same movie begs extended lord rings type dvd another 30 60 minutes give you what left out theatrical release,8
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,see spend bucks see big screen,3
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,huge fan books we have keep context movie there no way could have included all book i use movies fillers between books entertaining but just fillers said there were some glaring omissions vital next book why did mike newell extend dragon scene but leave out key characters because mistakenly hollywood thinks such exciting cgi more important fans books than expanding characters plot details wrong but we will go see movie anyway,1
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,i felt movie chopped up quiddich world cup while fascinatingly done movie over so quickly barely seemed part plot mr crouch suddenly dead but just left dangling why bother have sirius movie all his brief scene fire really disappointing his head should have been fully out embers book not part embers he barely recognizable sirius what waste,6
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,no ludo no winky dumbledore looking like bumbling idiot rather than worlds most powerful wizard most importantly whole end book gone where he has parting ways fudge ministry magic because fudges refusal believe voldermort back whole scene sets up next book,6
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,so where does movie adaptation shine script impeccable casting despite what some have said about daniel radcliffe he harry first movie his sweet innocence how he has grown into part he remains face i see when i read books emma watson needs tone down her overacting bit she near perfect first movie but hasnt really developed her character much rupert grint really shines movie his face handsome funny full expression he perfect ron phelps boys fred george really come into their own movie although how they start their joke shop without harrys triwizard winnings film 5 question since entirely missing movie nice see neville getting bigger more important role even though all his key info left out movie now ive read book six snape takes whole new meaning me again alan rickman has been perfect snape all movies,4
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,question whether three main characters should remain after release 5th movie summer 2007 seems dumb question me since when has hollywood ever cared about age actor part he she playing how often have we had 20 somethings playing teenagers there comes time when age daniel emma rupert will not matter audience personally i hope they play all movies,7
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,they say jk rowling has big say what stays what left out her books because she alone knows what happens how each piece jigsaw fits she must have been holiday when decisions were made movie perhaps directors cut dvd will explain also,4
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,first good news special effects music movie were best yet underwater scenes especially were very well done,9
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,thing i disliked most about movie albus dumbledore not portrayed calm wise old wizard he books instead he portrayed stormy confused old man doesnt have much clue whats going character dumbledore just way off one scene dumbledore grabs harry around neck shakes him whats about very thought albus dumbledore being physically violent student absolutely absurd thats not dumbledores character real harry potter fans all over going outraged portrayal dumbledore pretty much ruined movie me another thing i didnt like about movie so much real story left out andor changed i guess im just spoiled because im so attached books i know its impossible fit whole story 2 12 hour movie but there some pretty good stuff left out,1
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,if youre interested some things werent included movie stuck out my mind,1
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,im still ticked off about dumbledore im starting think people who make movies just dont even read books because dumbledore so out character made me angry bothers me more than anything else i wouldnt rush see movie wait until comes out dvd besides good special effects music movie really bad i hope review has been helpful,5
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,movie ran if were series highlight clips actual film representation fourth harry potter novel details were thrown haphazardly if no other reason than bring feeling recognition readers if viewer had not read book but only seen previous two movies she would not have understood movie screenwriters created no semblance complicated plot but rather rather singleminded story three tasks triwizard tournament all new characters were hardly introduced remained quite onedimensional which unfortunate even old favorites got shaft one there no time more than two short scenes either malfoy no magical lessons dobby house elf completely absent crouch never disappeared but his body found dead cinematics case were atrocious harry appears dumbledores chambers scene immediately after discovering crouchs body but then proceeds tell him about his scar hurting dreams rather than crouchs discovery there no magical map no latenight encounters moody no discussion snape karkaroffs relationship nor dumbledore trusting snape seeing relationship will rise single most prominent issue entire series i very disappointed find ignored favor large ineffective theatrics such hedge maze without any traps only shifting walls evil roots extremely obnoxious modernized yule ball pointlessly drawn out dragon chase scene dumbledores lines directing his acting made him look like old bumbling fool rather than clever mostpowerfulwizard planet only person whom voldemort afraid writers decided add crouch jr into harrys dreams completely removed second houseelf invisibility cloak quidditch world cup had audacity explain crouch jr had been sent azkaban but never explained his escape finally movie ended crouch jr being sent back azkaban minister magic never showed up dementors kill crouch dumbledore never argued him about verity harrys claims potential amazing cliffhanger conclusion dumbledore all his might giving orders hagrid others general before final battle instead replaced horrible attempt eulogy combining direct quotations novel poor scriptwriting make dumbledore out poor speaker well incompetent wizard i shudder think how next movie will have deal all these plot gaps how dumbledore can hope maintain any semblance respectability when he trusts snape continues avoid harry fifth movie much better would have been stick original idea make two movies movie didnt feel like had any plot one did not become attached characters spent movie groaning laughing contrived immaturity all some acting harry friends good but overshadowed terrible attempt fit everything nothing into movie,7

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,before i review film let me start off saying i am fan harry potter films have liked all them up point im not going compare movie book because most people know they two completely different animals there no way heaven hell gods green earth book size goblet fire could appropriate everything happened novel im going go what i saw up screen,1
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,what i saw up screen completely pedestrian effort made no attempt contributing style substance character development series getting better better each progressive film scenes start stop no explanation big action scenes especially fight dragon just begin no buildup whatsoever almost if youve stumbled upon someone playing new harry potter video game there no sense passage time all triwizard tournament consists only three challenges yet competition seems last entire school year ron hermione have blowup yule ball because his misplaced jealousy yet six months go last day school nothing more ever said about she even tells him he made mistake not asking her out he lets six more months go without saying word,10
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,i can forgive fact lot these things just glossed over because time crunch but i can not forgive situation after situation has something happen only because lead character needs live aforementioned fight dragon harry ends up hanging ledge 100 stories above ground trying reach his broom which nearby dragon lands building begins crawling down him slipping sliding peeling away shingles goes suddenly hit me harry hanging ledge defenseless dragon crawling toward him he dealing creature who spits fire who can fly one flap its wings quick belch harry crispy only reason doesnt because harry has live,1
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,matter no one film acts reacts situation because its their nature do so they react certain way because thats what script demands they do even if completely goes against their character everything we know about them when hermione blows up ron seems come out nowhere she seems mad because ron didnt ask her she wanted go him but if true why she so happy about being there competitor rival school i dont just mean happy i mean she absolutely beaming when she arrives him one point dumbledore grabs harry shakes him violently demanding he answer question my reaction wtf has dumbledore ever shown hes violent person he would grab student yelling his face course not but he does because script says he has one point film particular curse brought up allows you control another being thats kind funny because seems like every character film being controlled screenplay even if means going completely against character,8
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,but i guess biggest disappointment me confrontation between harry voldemort someone who has been built up devil he sure beaten easily end film quartet ghosts no less which took cheesiness new level appearance voldemort obviously supposed chilling but actuality he looks like hairless rat wearing cape great ralph fiennes does everything he can but part appeal character not seeing him closeup full daylight he shows up when he wants manages let harry live because hed rather talk him death instead just cutting off his head while harry pinned down but course thats because harry has live final confrontation again seems ridiculous retrospect,1
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,entire triwizard tournament seemed little offkilter me you perform tasks test your abilities try do better than your opponents but what end final test consists entering everchanging maze first competitor find trophy wins tournament so even if you finish dead last every other challenge if youre first find trophy you win anyway so i ask you whats friggin point even competing other challenges why put yourself harms way three times when you only have do once,9
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,looking back i just realized you could completely skip film move right number five without missing beat long you had someone tell you two things about film harrys interest cho voldemort being back sort heres hoping order phoenix doesnt follow same path,1
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,based one best books harry potter series film adaptation harry potter goblet had lot live up i think succeeded potter fans will know gof harry now fourteen his fourth year hogwarts when ancient tournament between hogwarts two other european wizarding schools held year seventh year contestant chosen each school compete but things go dramatically awry when harry three years too young even entered dangerous challenging tournament somehow also chosen after his name mysteriously nominated gof sharp turning point books tone darkens considerably characters themselves change being rather wideeyed innocent children adolescents thrust turbulent uncertain adult world where being good even innocent will not guarantee your survival shift also reflected film which rated 12a pg13 americans first hp films rated so high,6
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,i have say i did enjoy film although prisoner azkaban remains my favourite four unlike first two films did not attempt condescend much small children audience tasks triwizard tournament captured most thrills book particularly second waterbased task where merpeople were suitably creepy now we know why none kids go swimming summer term but first task overran minute two more than needed light romance touched upon yet wasnt overemphasised yule ball will please those who enjoyed scenes book but audience members over age sixteen might find teens ogling each other tad dull hermione very outofcharacter scene does drag,4
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,acting adult cast course exemplary always alan rickmans snape may only have had four so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while maggie smith really captured essence mcgonagall many people do miss richard harris dumbledore but i found michael gambon has done excellent job moulding role make his own gof dumbledore feels very human way he carries weight wizarding world his shoulders though he struggles times his concern his pupils paramount i finally felt close rapport between dumbledore harry film missing previous three hp flicks however prize has go brendan gleeson his scenestealing depiction madeye moody gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating moodys dangerous feral edge,1
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,younger cast have also grown into their roles improving their previous outing rupert grint usually used playing comical stupid ron had chance cut his acting teeth show rons darker bitter side he did well phelp twins have also improved dramatically no longer do they come across wooden cutouts just reading cuecard instead they able show mischievous spontaneity weasley twins i look forward seeing more matthew lewis who great showing nevilles sensitive side without making him too klutzy out younger cast though dan radcliffe one who has progressed most poa he awful he their friend scene so he seems like another boy harrowing graveyard scene aftermath depicting harrys anger feelings vulnerability grief he still stumbled occasion other scenes but i last have faith he might able do harry order phoenix justice when time comes,7
Swallow,not horror thriller so i can see why people might disappointed film if they were expecting its more psychological drama if anything strange film i never bored i give major props lead actress she made every scene gripping you really come understand her motivations why she does what she does i found ending perfect but i can see why could polarize lot viewers overall i adored acting story cinematography little strange but enchanting,8
Swallow,don´t expect any horror thill it´s drama movie which contains good portrait traumatized woman not more less,5
Swallow,i never felt urge leave review here due many reasons english not my native language im bad describing my emotions accurately but film drove me point you want end good girl so bad cant say i have same struggles her but i get way i cheered her even though its all so horrible cried my eyes out ending because its all right first time her life we got see light burst out her beautiful eyes exceptional acting haley bennett visuals die will one my all time favorites,10
Swallow,acting visuals great story line lacked punch could have made 7 8,6
Swallow,story sad but just didnt connect me i dissapointed end,6
Swallow,61,8
Swallow,well made well acted movie but movie spend too much time disorder pica how works plays out not enough her situation her family her husband his family because felt very much like awareness movie without any real meaning without anything thought provoking without payoff,6
Swallow,not thriller horror film drama about woman over edge who should outwardly seem like she has all gorgeous successful husband big beautiful home plenty money shes expecting her first child but all not how seems inside shes suffering deeply depression pica probably some form ptsd her lifes traumas shes eating nonfood items which making her increasingly sicker i wont say more except mental illness trauma affect people different ways i felt extreme compassion lead character watching her suffer dont just write film off important unforgettable people hurt sometimes hurt themselves inadvertently their own loved ones,8
Swallow,housewife hunter conrad haley bennett happily married young ceo husband richie conrad austin stowell however her life totally controlled her husband his family when she pregnant she stressed eats weirdest objects soon richies family hires male nurse psychologist take care hunter when they decide send her psychiatric hospital hunter learns she needs control her life,7
Swallow,swallow interesting film about pregnant wife pica disorder gorgeous haley bennett has excellent performance conclusion magnificent my vote six,9
Swallow,title brazil swallow,7
Swallow,some mild one major spoiler ahead watching mental demise main character saddening mentally challenging i found fascinating watch how she coped how her husband slowly tore her down without her knowledge entire film uncomfortable watch easiest part removal objects she has ingested which i think meant cringeworthy major spoiler i impressed see movie ended positive abortion scene,3
Swallow,extremely selfaware atoz psychological thriller about taking back your life through rituals control complete patriarchal caricatures metaphors intrusion left right think aronofskys motherbut dark comedy,9
Swallow,approaches level snakes plane teeth selfaware highconcept absurdity yet manages taken seriously thanks great performance lead actress haley bennett lush cinematography constant stream creative ways push autonomy message over top first frames film closeups farmtoplate preparation lamb meat,8
Swallow,swallow destined cultclassic its quintessentially bold fun unique indie film festival offering anna apocalypse film me last year,8
Swallow,highly recommended but not squeamish,1
Swallow,user here quoted movie dumb girl scores rich dude gets pregnant realizes she hates being housewife so she endangers child swallowing more more extreme bits around house yep about par course modern liberal woman,10
Swallow,did you understand movie all film about profound consequences trauma how affects mental illness when she swallowing things has nothing do wanting endanger child issue wasnt she hates being housewife issue she doesnt know who she related her past,8
Swallow,thank you very shallow review though,8
Swallow,i really wish imdb didnt have horror thriller tags movie neither those things going encourage wrong type people see film i went expecting horror vibe ended up enjoying actual product lot more than i suspect i wouldve alternative,9
Swallow,character study really good one haley bennett terrific lead role i love showcases point even if you have everything lot people aspire get wealth marriage not having work etc far guarantees happiness its old adage careful what you wish swallow aspect movie really only there point difference i understand why they have name movie but i genuinely believe would better off if theyd gone something different,3
Swallow,ending film highlight me handled such classy thoughtprovoking way not everyone may feel satisfied would prefer more justice angle have been taken but i really liked wasnt kind film justice angle i hope people dont go into film expecting one thing getting another being upset film i liked film lot would recommend giving look,1
Swallow,what could have been very interesting exploration pica psychological disorder writers chose tack some arbitrary larger causation ark simply did not work performances were great all around visual style pace arent problem either,8
Swallow,unfortunately characters onedimensional caricatures who not explored enough justify actions themselves lead end curiosity main theme played down focus apparent moral message,4
Swallow,its great when movies have message but when they fake undermines whole experience case appears they had no idea what they were trying communicate leaves you feeling very cheated more so than if they had simply presented stylised series unconnected events,10
Captain America: The First Avenger,wasnt bad movie but undoubtedly had few flaws terms screenplay story itself fine im personally big fan captain americas origin story so movie nice watch me maybe not so much if you dont care all about superheroes such ca,7
Captain America: The First Avenger,i loved movie captain america has had 3 movies past not counting some 1940s ones which can excused being good were so awful they make movies like steel green lantern look good however i saw lot critiques movie were negative now i understand differing opinions all but they all followed formula each one seemed like griping point just getting stupid if youll indulge me here i have list repeated ones rebuttal each,10
Captain America: The First Avenger,1 technology wwii too far advanced one most common stupidest my opinion its called fiction not real every time i heard one made me think these people have no suspension disbelief would complain iron man terrible movie because technology build flying robot suit doesnt exist yet people its comic books its fictional wwii setting its allowed take liberties,10
Captain America: The First Avenger,2 captain america too invincible just stupid captain america relatively weak compared many other superheroes hes just perfect example human being brought about experiments film also hes main character hes not supposed die movie leading him up tiein all other recent marvel films will lead avengers,9
Captain America: The First Avenger,3 red skull terrible villain,6
Captain America: The First Avenger,there no sense one hes supposed guy thats worse than hitler can get just many people his side do his bidding top he can take cap fight fairly evenly saying hes bad villain baseless,5
Captain America: The First Avenger,4 steve doesnt go through character arcget any backstory,8
Captain America: The First Avenger,one he really doesnt need steve good guy start he did go through arc subtle but he did he gained more confidence become soldier he he has backstory but its weaved throughout we know he bullied lot we know he he military family we know he grew up bucky we know he has had very few if any dates his life hes childhood friend bucky we know he wants soldier because he feels its his duty id rather get weaved through narrative story rather than get huge text dump just have characters talking half hour about everything theyve ever done,8
Captain America: The First Avenger,5 movie just glorifies america not really its good vs evil story happens have character named captain america which given him publicity stunt i suppose you also hate movies like saving private ryan because tells things perspective american soldiers but not japanese ones,8
Captain America: The First Avenger,these were most common arguments they easily refutable captain america great movie showcasing one best marvel has offer should 7s higher not 6s,9
Captain America: The First Avenger,people suck thats only reason movie rated low i love movie,9
Captain America: The First Avenger,like many comicbook fans i expecting worst movie not because character has any less depth than other superheroes but i knew would extremely difficult transition steve rogers film serviceable way guy called captain america heavens sake,10
Captain America: The First Avenger,any comicbook reader would probably appreciate ironies idiosyncrasies behind such ostentatiously patriotic codename mostly because print cap has challenged assumptions behind his symbolism becoming more conflicted universal figure,8
Captain America: The First Avenger,but its hard translate any idiosyncrasy successfully 2 hours fortunately film instead getting political more oldfashioned pulp like indy sky captain which thankfully never takes itself too seriously which one flaws thor,2
Captain America: The First Avenger,i had my doubts chris evans could pull off modesty heart needed role but i wrong red skull hugo weaving wonderfully evil nostalgic serialvillain kind way haley atwell sidekickloveinterest rare quality not being incredibly annoying tommy lee jones perfectly cast tommy lee jones,8
Avatar,avatar tells familiar story but its story works so well inside movie visuals 3d still one best date i totally get why made so much money,9
Avatar,im not exactly sure when became thing among my tribe film geeks bash avatar i know wasnt when came out because most film fans my circle nerdy friends went watch multiple times couldnt get enough hindsight i suspect around time when everybody their grandmother seemed have seen somehow once film had become most successful movie ever unadjusted inflation stopped being cool like james camerons ecoscifi extravaganza,8
Avatar,nowadays film often brought up snarky movie blogs typical example film great effects but dull story unoriginal ideas bland characters if were somehow general consensus among film aficionados ferngully space dances wolves blue catpeople some kinder descriptions film has endure which all honesty i dont get,6
Avatar,i mean its fine not like movie all art subjective all but how so many selfprofessed film experts now pretend critically acclaimed picture which metacritic rated even higher than dark knight nothing but bland unoriginal runofthemill hollywood blockbuster only succeeded thanks then novelty 3d frankly beyond me,10
Avatar,what i find even more astounding how very people who decry lack original directordriven blockbusters hollywood often same who turn up their noses avatar original directordriven blockbuster came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels adaptations already existing intellectual properties ideas film not original they claim come guys seriously,6
Avatar,so youve seen world like pandora before bioluminescent visual wonder merges colorful marine life coral reefs lush vegetation tropical rain forests world where nature forms actual neural network stores memories builds collective consciousness youve seen many films about biodatabase people can plug themselves into via ancient trees communicate their ancestors,10
Avatar,youve watched countless blockbusters take place ecosystem where you can form instant symbiosis other creatures depending your needs way how many ecoscifi films have you seen such wornout concept tired old subgenre right,9
Avatar,no my friends terms hollywood blockbusters these ideas concepts about original they come some them even inspired actual biological phenomenons like discovery roots trees do indeed form sort neural network symbiosis fungi where they able store exchange information but what true filmmaker cleverly chose very straightforward story get his environmentalist plea anticolonial antiimperialist message across make some rather complex scifi ideas more accessible broad audience,10
Avatar,end film uses certain wellknown story tropes spy who changes sides once he falls love enemy soldier who realizes hes been fighting wrong cause invader who gets know appreciate foreign culture hes invading timeless trope fish out water but they not what film about those tropes not copied dances wolves either any more than film stole them pocahontas they so universal you can find variations any one them numerous legends stories thus also throughout film history lawrence arabia shogun last samurai countless others,8
Avatar,yes our heroes jake neytiri not most complex characters though neither they bland films most vicious detractors claim but thats because they arent really films main focus avatars actual protagonist its true star if you will pandora its world we get experience through jakes eyes really matters here film aims straight your gut not your scifi nerd brain which i suspect actual reason why so many former cameron fans now claim disappointed film,9
Avatar,more than anything avatar wants you lose your heart beautiful planet functions obvious standin our own threatened world film unapologetic uncynical declaration love wonders nature well call action preserve them which emotional level works marvelously nothing film painful shocking destruction single big tree which symbolizes quite literally nature home shelter we depend upon its genius scene i dare you find action blockbuster where distruction city whole planet carries even shred emotional heft falling home tree does camerons film,9
Avatar,so again im trying hammer my point home here avatar simple yes but thats point simplicity familiarity story deliberate themes not just derivative retreads theyre universal those myths fairy tales thus speak everyone thats exactly what camerons intention use simple enough tropes archetypes convey heartfelt message would work across cultural borders reach people all over world which given films success obviously did,1
Avatar,personally i think avatar prime example visual emotional storytelling done right viewing first time offers experience almost without equal its immersiveness while may only have been my own individual experience avatar also first movie long time completely vowed me sense i felt like little kid again theater which had very little do novelty 3d also last time film managed do,1
Avatar,even terms pure entertainment film simply spectacular its rousing adventure gorgeous visuals topnotch cgi filled fascinating creatures jawdropping futuretech final 40 minutes film provide all out nonstop scifi action thrillride scale world had rarely if ever seen before,1
Avatar,obviously doesnt mean its perfect film i already pointed out its fair not like any number reasons above all personal taste but avatar far deserving kind snark ridicule gets these days get over people simple doesnt equal simplistic fact avatar neither subtle nor cynical doesnt make dumb even if does make harder some us nerds like wihtout feeling slightly embarassed,1
Avatar,all honesty i believe if had been slightly more obscure film instead most successful movie all time many same people who hate now would hail epic scifi adventure classic ages far im concerned thats exactly what avatar modern classic visionary filmmaker true auteur rant over,1
Avatar,i had rather intense privilege view james camerons much anticipated 400 million budget return directing scene avatar empire leicester square london,8
Avatar,where begin visuals pieces groundbreaking he did terminator series then titanic so one would expect cameron deliver he did visual far some sharpest cgi i have seen you could almost say there disquiet follows camerons soul there no other possibility strong intensified quality its production design visual effects both noteworthy will get its praise upon official release,1
Avatar,what lacking really should have shaped movie its characterstory i expecting complex believable plot but left movie mostly strong visuals what most scifi lovers desire mindbending philosophies fantasy exploration limitations our outer species if not factor i would give 95 vote,9
Avatar,avatar will success not only because camerons legacy but very intelligent viral marketing avatar have had powerful marketing technique assembles other successful blockbusters such blair witch project you all remember dark knight joker invades world also current production artifice theartificecom intelligently targeting market,4
Avatar,kudos cameron avatar one if not movie year i could get trouble sharing you guys so early so please click yes above comment useful you thank you,6
Avatar,well i just saw avatar morning one press premieres which running these days my opinion youve seen story hundred times but never like finally 3d what its supposed instrument service movie youll enjoy visual experience no doubt,5
Avatar,story some inspirations so huge so obvious mentioning two three them would really ruin movie you im not willing do lots mysticism ecology if you like stuff if youre 15 so youll have great time thinking its first time somebody makes something like if youre experienced movie watcher better leave your skepticism door bring lots pop corn enjoy usual actionflickwithmoralandloadsofclichés,10
Se7en,movie se7en starring brad pitt morgan freeman gwyneth paltrow far one most inventive wellwritten cerebral films recent history film blending well put together combination dark visual style intense plot development polished acting remains tight focused throughout beginning end never straying outwards into unimportant issues resorting typical hollywood clichés se7en uniquely its own suspense dramas both fuels need audience drawn entertained events unfolding remain uncompromising shocking thus satisfying initial vision director david fincher,10
Se7en,story surrounds hunt serial killer who inspired dante alighieris seven deadly sins divine comedy sets out preach about mans impurity does so targeting victims then torturing them pitting their own underlining sins against them se7en seemingly starts out typical cat mouse detective story however quickly develops into sort modernmyth good evil taking centre stage story original all counts thrilling all levels most important aspect se7en however keeps audience numerous steps behind its story oppose other thrillers which become predictable bland end keeping audience dark film remains fresh original progresses se7en even dramatically turns tide one point just audience finally getting comfortable asserted into gloomy atmosphere thus creating much fear uncertainty audience characters involved films conclusion audience much apart film characters themselves arrive se7ens surprise ending without single clue prior occurring se7ens poetic endingwhich will not given away says lot people behind movie showing they not afraid going against grain rarity films so nowadays,10
Se7en,directed brilliantly david fincher skillfully written andrew kevin walker se7en well crafted ingeniously clever making one greatest films 90s while se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim such films silence lambs se7en undoubtedly influential any film date,10
Se7en,score 1010,10
Se7en,rarity film completely unsettling yet unrelentingly gripping,10
Se7en,david finchers story takes place bleak constantly raining city never named where urban decay sleaze all forms rampant coming up his retirement police force detective lieutenant somerset morgan freeman who tasked breaking his replacement detective sergeant mills brad pitt before leaving somerset world weary under no illusions about futility daily role he plays initially wants nothing more than escape grime violence city mills other hand convinced he going make real difference having voluntarily transferred precinct bringing his wife city him before somerset can move homicide comes which he mills assigned investigate but its only first string ritual murders will committed killer who basing his crimes seven deadly sins depicted dantes divine comedy,10
Se7en,begin se7en appears standard cops trail killer story which shouldnt too difficult audience get comfortable but we descend along characters into merciless brutal world without hope they inhabit you left reeling events unfold,10
Se7en,two detectives enjoy uneasy relationship no real friendship ever striking up between them older somerset educated astute gives impression being emotionally burnt out mills who has no respect somersets methodical investigating gets excited thought solving murder firmly believes good guys will win eventually further we get into action might evil they face pushes both men beyond their limits,10
Se7en,film draws heavily biblical themes you can certainly see similarities such films seventh seal 1957 both films show price good men have pay when they fight evil unsettling truth rule book goes straight out window when you dealing something so diabolical has no boundaries limits all,10
Se7en,se7en shows us world which has been destroyed its own sins wasteland which values minimal killer having nothing but contempt world sees his mission expose faults show everyone what they have become fascinating twist when killers motives become clearer somerset his greater understanding actually feels some degree empathy him lost mills though whose level clarity never reaches same point,9
Se7en,previous reviewer mentioned you begin expect unexpected whilst watching se7en i completely agree eventually if you think most obvious outcome any situation predict opposite will happen usually does even finale itself became kind predictable because then you conditioned not have any hope minor flaw though because story so well so shockingly told,10
Se7en,director david fincher didnt pick up another script 18 months such his exhaustion frustration following completion alien 3 apparently he agreed direct se7en after one reading andrew kevin walkers screenplay because he drawn its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity he stated its psychologically violent implies so much not about why you did but how you did camera work specially altered film stock used make visuals look dark unsettling possible which complemented well howard shores music score,9
Se7en,most disturbing message se7en puts across fight against evil destined pyrrhic victory but regardless only thing we can do fight whatever cost we have no other choice,9
Se7en,world fine place worth fighting i agree second part,10
Se7en,seldom does film elucidate culpability our cultureof our society mayhem madness we often find everyday life according se7en our culture drifting through darkness mouthpiece thematic undercurrent somerset literate man who also happens detective man who can read clue isnt going happy ending dantes inferno equal aplomb he even provides films final thematic statement quote hemingway his quirkiness perhaps outgrowth brilliant mind no worse than any prophet seer old those harbingers biblical insight whom others always find kooky offbeat he not well loved his cynical pessimistic outlook such his consuming motivation retire get out town however end becomes clear somerset who sees our dark world prophets particular clarity left his partner mills find out hard way,10
Se7en,working us reinforce world somerset sees films astounding miseenscene disturbing filmnoir setting developed director david fincher cinematographer darius khondji flashlights barely illuminate slimy walls roachinfested tenement one victim dark bedroom another rain pours down buckets birdseyeview shots downtown city never named generic everymans kind place show dingy sooty rooftops grimy streets only films closing scene bright sunlight which then only serves ironic counterpoint what we see happening,10
Se7en,somersets vision both inhabited described him he finds surprising fellow traveler not his partner but elusive killer john doe doe shares vision provides unsettling echo rumblings teachings somerset if one looks life through somerset lens one must admit john doe has valid point he somerset have arrived same conclusion difference between them being how they have responded somerset longs escape some otherworldly realm country doe has taken action,6
Se7en,though gripping fast moving not action film holds our interest through workings horror mystery stark filmnoir detective piece except one tense pursuit through halls alleys pouring rain well bit ending action there surprisingly little violence we see each murder save two after fact crime scene only makes final act much more suspenseful,10
Se7en,very tight film elements within dialogue actions lighting setting all these tend reinforce one another paint solid picture perverse logic makes final seventh sin complete perfectly circle events begun first,7
Se7en,sevens quality puts so far beyond most cops trail deranged killer genre comes out true jewel cinema everything about seven perfect art captured film movie bright spot all stars who worked,9
The Lodge,lodge latest entry trend horrordramas like hereditary babadook follows which light jump scares more concerned telling compelling humanstory slowly builds up tension powerful climax however unlike its predecessors i think lodge muddles story horror built around core concept solid classic setup group characters conflicting interests trapped isolated place pushed brink their sanity until all hell breaks loose but film failed sucking me getting me invested characters which dulled impact when horrific events began happening biggest culprit how main character grace written despite having compelling backstory i never felt like i knew what her wants needs weaknesses were which resulted her coming off lifeless shell who plot happened not because i think stronger clearer characterization grace would have made very sympathetic protagonist i wouldnt want bad things happen allowing horror more effective additionally dialogue parts felt very clunky unnatural possibly stemming being written nonenglish speaking screenwriters ultimately end movie my suspensionofdisbelief completely broken so no matter how wellexecuted horror i disengaged just waiting movie end which real shame because movie does have some clever impressive horror sequences would really hit home if writing had been par my advice would wait one become available digitally skip theaters its worth watch horror diehards but not full price ticket,6
The Lodge,movie relatively good movie goers cannot seem watch movies what they now but constantly need analyze compare elements movie other films movie little slower side if you like slow building psychological thrillers one you,7
The Lodge,i am not surprised all negative reviews movie starts well sets up story well then falls flat so hard its like taking popcorn out oven soon one pops smells nice but reality youre left only hard tasteless kernels,4
The Lodge,lets address elephant room not intelligent movie however does have enough pretentious cinematography make some people think being said i am fan said cinematography set up but not your entire substance i have no idea why some people calling innovative simply isnt long drawn out shots darkened empty hallway window while someone frantically plucks untuned violin radiofiltered whispers neither groundbreaking not original yes its uncomfortable so overdoing will elicit emotional reaction which some people mistake effect good writing,6
The Lodge,now beyond elephant story goes absolutely nowhere if movie original anything its ending so mediocre so little attempt has been made make interesting its rarity genre if you know there no twist ending you can guess finish good 15 minutes after word go characters profoundly unlikable aside dad who appears briefly beginning end there creepy scenes which go nowhere have absolutely no explanation nor do they contribute plot i am looking you 100 snow angels,9
The Lodge,being said i do appreciate movies which try least get part equation right one stated above has good first part now if only moviemakers learned you need know how finish story too so while i wouldnt wholeheartedly recommend if youre into eating only first couple popcorns bunch being disappointed rest go just warned moment you start asking yourself ok so where all going moment when you know movie well past its peak,8
The Lodge,i quite excited movie just saw lisbon international horror filme festival,4
The Lodge,fact movie seemed really brilliant its first half building tension causing some doubts audience about existence paranormal stuff going not problem exactly storyline really confusing lacking some explanations second half movie slow pace,7
The Lodge,final twist expected save day but opposite,2
The Lodge,film very unsettling more i think about sadder i get after film over i felt horrible very depressing film has not touched me much emotionally since whiplash,9
The Lodge,but great film i am glad i had privilege seeing early local film festival portrays human cruelty its ramifications very adeptly films does great job building tension making you feel unsettled very cramped interiors all sets doll house whispered prayers add eerie atmosphere riley keough gives great performance alicia silverstone great opening,2
The Lodge,somethings not quite right story unfolds its not what you think film fooled me i liked another great film these two directors about bratty children,1
The Lodge,movies rely obvious means conveying fright criticised utilising cheap scares while those build atmosphere tension such title called boring nonsensical charitable fan all things horror i can appreciate everything genre encompasses if its executed decently maybe not so much when comes slashers torture features,7
The Lodge,lodge slow burner sets unnerving mood pretty effectively there trail breadcrumbs although initially slightly puzzling had effect keep my interest peaked right until twist movie weaves ideas such grief resentment trauma into very good guessing game yes its been done before but my opinion time around felt better maybe because acting which i really enjoyed perhaps choice setting even maybe due how pieces puzzle werent made fall into place neither forcefully nor conveniently my biggest surprise twist reveal which happened after roughly 2 thirds movie wasnt only payoff instead movie added karmic resolution top although unsettling made absolute sense i honestly dont know what angry reviewers watched but they might want keep insults towards directors movie minimum if they cant objective parallels other films honestly besides minimal similarities goodnight mommy same directors after all i couldnt see anything else there also whole entertain multiple possibilities until reveal type storytelling i previously mentioned another theme lodge explores dark side religion could have contributed my opinion unfairly low rating movie,10
The Lodge,me lodge hit spot its creepy atmosphere bleak overtones subdued but true situation way acting sadly these very same aspects might have displeased some viewers,8
The Lodge,there good films there bad films there films convinced they belong louvre when they nought but selfindulgent boring claptrap you guessed right you smarty pants film buff lodge fits right into latter category aims being intelligent wonderfully filmed acted slowburner but ends up being intellectual equivalent someone who ate double portion beans unwittingly locked himself closet,1
The Lodge,i came thought going sinister paranormal type horror movie according unreliable trailer but turned out psychological thriller rattled me all through movie i trying realize what dark entity haunting characters then turned out nothing but faux shocked me i liked film definitely nice experience watching but during watch i so confused what going if what creators intended do making film then very good job but i feel confused feeling kind what made film not good i wanted other than great making photography good main atmosphere film has character its own,1
The Lodge,first half gives similar uncomfortable feeling watching hereditary midsommar but then becomes stale flat twist pretty lame ending felt too slow rushed same time great suspensehorror leaves you thinking about stories days afterwards one you wont care about soon you leave theater,2
The Lodge,while i am not huge fan horror i very impressed lodge very intelligently written never lost my interest oddly other reviews currently imdb really hated itand i am not sure why,4
The Lodge,story finds couple children being drug cabin freezing wilderness christmas holiday i say drug because trip will include dads new girlfriendand kids blame her their parents failed marriage much trip girlfriend will watch kids father has work will going back city few days meantime weather other factors conspire make prospective stepmother lose her mind can kids manage survive there much more story than thismany twists interesting story elements such lady having belonged suicide cult childbut if i tell more might ruin suspense,1
The Lodge,bottom line film usually difficult predict motivations breakdown were interesting not slasher film but more intelligent psychological thrillerwell worth seeing very unsettling,3
The Lodge,movie lover im always interested seeing all kinds movies even if movie had low reviews im always willing give movie shot however lodge failed deliver nail biting horror flick confusing plot holes mumbled dialogue anticlimactic twist most freaky scene 10 minutes into movie rest slow drawn out movie less than exciting i honestly dont know why movie has decent reviews granted trailer promising but movie boring,1
The Lodge,i dont tend review much but i do tend rely heavily reviews so when i saw decent reviews i figured im going see decent moviewrong omg sitting through one brutal first off not horror movie its more about woman battling anxiety mental health idk next sooooo slow you can pretty much guess plot twist few scenes shots made zero sense like had nothing do story line whole time i kept watching my watch i honestly wanted get up leave but my date insisted we stay because he sure ending would make up everything well did not skip movie,4
The Lodge,i attended east coast premiere lodge few weeks ago can say will most likely 2020s most polarizing divisive horror release,8
The Lodge,if youve seen franz fialas last film goodnight mommy youll have idea what expect terms tone themes cinematography breathtaking riley keoughs performance unbelievable like mommy central characters two siblings who up against some sort unknownunstable maternal presence while existing isolation instead vast lonely european farm lodge features exactly what title suggests mountain lodge middle nowhere its so well done you can almost feel icy frost theater film progresses,1
Alien,what makes alien great its synchronization sound visuals showing great attention detail not only but alien has unnerving atmosphere right beginning were introduced crew who not exactly too friendly each other add ship its huge its halls corridors feels almost like maze,10
Alien,enter alien ruthless parasite humanoid form yet lacks any civilised traits human does have humanoid form but doesnt give single emotion design monster whats most terrifying still holds up despite alien being released 1979 creature also better adapted ships interior making big part movie feel like sinister game cat mouse,10
Alien,what i particularly like how characters written they not hollywoodized heroes fact there no hero theyre just people which makes them even more threatened performances all equally realistic do deliver kudos director ridley scott using crafty cinematography combining shadows lights eerie way music unrelenting combined scotts cinematography sound visuals adds eeriness,10
Alien,plot also not another hollywoodized cliché its more like survival fittest characters battle true terror they race survive outlive each other theyre all just part race see who will prevail who will die,9
Alien,final rating 1010,10
Alien,masterpiece one best classic scifi horror films 70s i have ever saw experience first time i saw film 97 when i 13 years old because film so popular time even today people talks about watching first time film i must say i loved i love film death all scifi films today one best one beats them all real science fiction film about extraterrestrial life form interesting brilliant about time space life form wants whip whole humanity out ridley scotts masterpiece one his best films all time everything about film perfect script actors puppetry models special effects about alien design,10
Alien,i would give movie 8 but deserves perfect 10 because has vision most imaginative directors earth dan obannon wrote brilliantly story screenplay help ronald shusett both them make brilliant imaginative story film has no plot holes i dont see them helen horton voice mother nostromos computer believable realistic well performed design parasite facehugger excellent designed brilliant,10
Alien,everyone cast here acting spectacular acts believable i love all characters parker brett lambert ripley ash captain dallas kane even jonesy cat he really trained i love cat movie design about ship nostromo fantastic so space computers film eponymous alien its accompanying elements were designed swiss artist h r giger which effects designs were excellent spectacular created film jerry goldsmith makes excellent music score film i have enjoy,9
Alien,my favorite scene film when parker torchers flamethrower ashs corpse burns his remains great special effect movie stars tom skerritt sigourney weaver veronica cartwright harry dean stanton john hurt ian holm yaphet kotto bolaji badejo helen horton they all believable their roles,10
Alien,my favorite science fiction film tough i prefer aliens over film because my favorite film thing leviathan even blob horror films because i enjoy them more but alien my favorite science fiction film best its kind 1010 doesnt deserve hate,10
Alien,alien one those special films have aged very very well even now after nearly 40 years everything about just feels fresh restrained natural performances fantastic cast outstanding production design beautiful ominous score jerry goldsmith realistic livedin look spacefreighter nostromos interior actually feels less dated than many science fiction films were made much later which quite astonishing feat even what now must considered retro technology inside ship doesnt necessarily have viewed anachronistic face our obvious recent advancements because its most simple technological equipment usually robust enough survive longest under harsh conditions like extreme temperatures space,10
Alien,i feel its especially hard science fiction films stand test time which kind inherent genre i suppose alien simply remains outstanding achievement regard its testament talent everyone involved but especially vision director ridley scott film crafted so much love every little detail designs moebius chris foss particular lovecraftian horrors unleashed swiss surrealist hr giger among best most iconic any science fiction film isnt just outstanding timeless piece entertainment its work art 10 stars out 10,10

Alien,alien we follow seven man crew enroute earth board huge space freighter nostromo crew cryosleep but board computer interrupts journey when foreign radio signal picked up originates uninhabited planet crew lands investigate there they make contact alien lifeform,10
Alien,what makes alien so great constant feel uneasiness right beginning you have feeling something wrong crew not particularly friendly towards each other you truly feel all ingroup tension ship itself huge worn out industrialstyle maze halls corridors feels more like prison than place live if not only alien but also ship itself against humans alien itself scariest monster history because ruthless soulless parasite completely devoid any human civilized traits design monster stroke genius sure has humanoid form but has no facial traits anything else which could give away emotions intentions its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence alien more less opposite everything human civilized plus creature more welladapted inhumane interior ship than humans who build sum up you then have setting where humans caught web ingroup tensions inhospitable ship perfect killer which thrives ships intestines you almost get feel humans ones who alienated each other their own ship,10
Alien,ridley scott tells story perfectly synchronized blend visuals sounds,10
Alien,actors do superb job portraying their characters subtle but very realistic way seven man crew not bunch hollywood heroes they ordinary people strengths weaknesses likes dislikes way they all seem so fragile when confronted enemy,10
Alien,mentioned ship very claustrophobic ridley scott adds eeriness using camera movement lights shadows effective way living quarters bright should comfortable crew but there something sterile about all rest ship basically huge basement,9
Alien,music jerry goldsmith underlines eeriness so well movie wouldnt have worked without his score combined sounds ship all adds uneasiness,9
Mortal Engines,movie starts great sequence introducing us post apocalypticsteampunk world how works but their movie predictable rushed story lines you have seen elsewhere executed better elsewhere its predictablility wouldnt hurt if story most its characters were compelling enough allow audience invested care third act movie began i quickly tried rummage through entire movie trying justify watching movie i left only few reasons one them world created,6
Mortal Engines,standout character shrike solid arc amazing design you have seen character trailer,7
Mortal Engines,when i heard name concept movie its about big cities wheels i thought wtf what stupid idea wasted talent money cgi however i found movie pretty entertaining good parts,5
Mortal Engines,now if you think movie modern fairy tale children teenagers than more than ok if you expect more well here bad things,6
Mortal Engines,however movie manages entertain pity box office flop probably because concept itself which hard sell lack efficient marketing bad critic reviews mostly lack big names would draw interest not mention competition other movies launched same period such aquaman,5
Mortal Engines,conclusion you will not regret seeing movie if you want see visually stunning modern fairy tale but dont expect lord rings,6
Mortal Engines,comedy goes its classic gold london has been transferred presumably via futuristic huge forklift truck some kind onto huge chassis now chugging its way across mainland europe needing fuel has capability gobbleup take barnier other towns cities also roaming countryside which london digests smoke tusk curiously captured cities inhabitants not exterminated but integrated into citys population so much any antiimmigration policy lol,8
Mortal Engines,but all doesnt go entirely smoothly uk capital lord mayor london patrick malahide declares we should never have gone into europe its biggest mistake we ever made classic how we snorted laughter,6
Mortal Engines,stuffing squarely remainers london makes its own future its time show world how strong london can having conquered most europe its time set its sights new markets conquer so london takes chinese now tears laughter flowing freely trade deals have never been more entertaining since star wars phantom menace,4
Mortal Engines,ok so interests advertising standards id better make clear before you rush out cinema expecting comedy feature my tongue firmly my cheek here mortal engines latest scifi feature peter jackson but when viewed brexit perspective its hilarious,6
Mortal Engines,terms plot like waterworld makes clever use universal logo set agenda world has been decimated worldwide war though clearly one selectively destroyed bits london not others survivors must try survive any way they can settlements divided between those static those like london mobile constantly evolving municipal darwinism hysterically described but london rather powercrazed londoner thaddeus valentine hugo weaving wants revolution rather than evolution he working development one superweapons started worlds demise first place,4
Mortal Engines,but hester shaw hera hilmar separated when young her mother pandora yes she has box weve seen wink wink intent stopping him since she personal path vengence teaming up londoner tom robert sheehan activist anna fang jihae they must face both thaddeus everrelentless shrike stephen lang try derail destructive plan,7
Mortal Engines,anna fang declares im not subtle neither movie film loud actionfilled significant plus visually extremely impressive im not great fan excessive cgi but here essential specialeffects team do great job production design tremendous lot money has been thrown costume design inventive highspot again snortworthy being beefeater guards costumes,4
Mortal Engines,where film really crashes like postbrexit stock market dialogue screenplay jackson himself his regular writers fran walsh phillipa boyens contains some absolute clunkers notwithstanding unintended lolworthy brexit irony its jawdroppingly bad believe me,3
Mortal Engines,turns only real name whole film jacksonfavourite hugo weaving just about everyone else cast pretty well unknown many cases shows standing head shoulders though me over rest cast icelandic actress hera hilmar who strikes splendidly feisty pose mentally physically scarred hester i look forward seeing what she does next,4
Mortal Engines,storywise theres not scifi film thats not been looted number other films seem plundered too i cant comment how much comes source book philip reeve londonmobile looks all world like monty pythons crimson permanent assurance company teenage female lead sarah connors relentlessly pursued terminator male lead archaologist cum hotshot pilot indiana solo leather jacket all there blade runner moment battle meld great wall morannon lord rings two towers less sophisticated aerial location empire strikes back another classic star wars moment without words being actually said,6
Mortal Engines,now im loathe say anything bad about director peter jackson after his breathtakingly memorable they shall not grown old film has its moments flair most memorably life flashing before your eyes scene i found genuinely moving but overall actioner its bit mess its long way being worse film ive seen year long stroke kept me interested amused equal measure running time but i think given its initially bombed box office any plans jackson had deliver series these movies might need selffunded,4
Mortal Engines,full graphical review please check out one manns movies web facebook thanks,9
Mortal Engines,first things first i lucky enough able go prepremier amsterdam watched movie imax i highly recomand watching format,6
Mortal Engines,basicly what you watching movie almost seems aim next terrible tween trilogy but story not half bad filled plotholes obnoxious characters refusing explain just why they have drive their cities but overall enjoyable,8
Mortal Engines,true attrection however scenery boy worth cities look amazing planes buildings everything film dressed impress made me want crawl through screen just marvel beauty all,7
Mortal Engines,so yeah movie kinda like watching anime like howls moving castle without subtitles i have no idee what they trying say but sure looks nice,1
Mortal Engines,like many reviews said you can easily spot other films plots one predictable basic 0 empathy characters save yourself some money watch home when available,8
Mortal Engines,rating 6510 only good thing about novie were visual when moster who keeps hester shaw child forgives her free promise she has made first 10 15 minutes movie boring me movie not bad just average,8
Mortal Engines,effects movie quite excellent atmosphere place took film quite spectacular amazing movie continues plot quite quick not much conversation break during show lot action some plot movie not too reasonable but still acceptable me one worth watching movie 2018,8
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,june 8 2002 80s renaissance me playing emulated colecovision my pc listening huey lewis prince men work watching ateam tnn seeing film 1989 i still enjoy decade feathered mullets jerricurled hair acidwashed jeans skinny ties dominant pop music terrible fashions 90s will never have live down except terrible fashions but not bad,8
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,when bill teds excellent adventure became surprise hit 1989 made star everyones favorite lebanesecanadianus rock n rolling actor keanu reeves who one top stars box office today one few likeable people tinseltown seems he still carries bit theodore ted logan all his movies,8
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,he alex winter indie film dynamo play bill ted couple 80s california dudes who want start their own rock band wyld stallyons however both flunking high school will expelled unless they get history make matters worse ted will sent military his father therefore squashing their dreams rock stardom enter rufus george carlin man future who plays clarence boys george shades its wonderful life who gives them telephone booth they decide use collect great historical figures bring them san dimas california show them how mankind has evolved,10
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,surprisingly film holds up today bill ted truly likeable boneheads both reeves winter deliver fine performances carlin funny his appearances showing he doesnt need trashtalk entertaining dialogue truly amusing probably because no one talks like any more only weakness its 80s film so if you didnt grow up era you might not understand why theres music playing throughout film why everyone looks dresses so weird yes thats how everyone looked 1980s dvd version quite nice but only has trailer bonus still must watch much better than all copycat films including horrible dude wheres my car party,7
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,despite success such films speed matrix trilogy lot people keanu reeves will always ted taller darker half bill ted duo would seem ted all reeves many characters possibly only one where he really seemed have put himself into role felt like natural,6
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,one great dopey dude slacker classics title characters bill alex winter ted aforementioned reeves pair aspiring musicians wild stallions who danger being both separated if ted cant pull up good enough grade which military school flunking history class general but since they destined 2 great ones whos music will unite earth even alien races together universal harmony most excellent dude rufus george carlin shows up gives them time traveling phone booth help them pass their history class bringing back real historical figures like billy kid abraham lincoln napoleon joan ark what not now all they have do keep them getting separated jailed before they have pass history along way bill ted also fall love two sexy virgin princesses medieval circa,8
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,yeah its not great cinema but its fun romp slacker dude madness thanks energy enthusiasm alex winter keanu reeves title characters,7
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,followed bill teds bogus journey,8
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,movie rules am i afraid admit nope cause its truth i know reading some my reviews i sound like some stuffy person who doesnt like any fluffy comedies unintelligent humor but thats not always case yes there good fluffy comedies promise really fun watch,10
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,i cant even count how many times ive seen movie but somehow never gets old bill ted course not great movie but never pretends one i guess thats why i like so much,7
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,ive always had huge fascination idea time travel why else would i love back future so much movie actually makes look really really fun not mention bill teds mispronunciation historical figures names socrates makes all more hilarious,9
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,did i mention rufus totally awesome no well go ahead kick me face,9
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,any idiot can sit down spend four seven years his life writing out his masterpiece you do some research you do some hard work you get little help friends family you get done but takes true writing genius geniuses case create something original bill teds excellent adventure ingenuity movie can even seen its delightful tagline history about rewritten two guys who cant spell tagline both simple clever while being both corny slightly comical like real genius film utilizes ideas both highest form screenwriting while still delving into lowest common denominator somehow doing both same time instance perfectly grasp concept bill teds lingo one would truly have stoop lowest rung intelligence level but such ingenius ideas having bill ted meet each other beginning film then later finding themselves allowing audience gain insight what happened past just stroke cinematic brilliance running gag about when mongols conquered china one many cherries cake even some background comments after being told hes too tall man making phone booth even more crowded lincoln responds thats how im built any movie where genghis kahn tempted come into phone booth twinkie has something special if only production companies filmmakers would take chance something original time travelling phone booth carrying two idiots course better future public could finally go back watching movies theaters again,9
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,wow talk about childhood classic bill ted first surfaced when i nine years old those were daysi dont know how many times my best friend i watched one but must have been every day during our third grade year ive watched countless times after has yet lose its charm when bill teds bogus journey came out couple years later process repeated itself these two movies about couple seemingly burnout teens who dont take drugs which leads one conclusion they were just born idiots thing just being stupid everything seems happen right them wherever they go thanks good ole rufus george king carlan,10
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,excellent adventure starts our idiot duo doing what they do jamming out garage guitars they cant play talking nonstop about how someday somehow their band wyld stalyns will open iron maiden when their dream threatened reality they flunking out history things take turn what all boils down they need have badass history report theyre both going flunk out ted will sent military school his mean police officer dad,7
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,where rufus comes he shows up time machine form phone booth claims have all answers their problems time machine just what they need their history report so its back time we go capture historically significant figures socrates napolean billy kid joan arc abe lincoln etc fun never stops,1
Suicide Squad,my god awful just random madefortrailer tiny scenes add nothing have zero depth dont make up coherent plot walltowall inappropriate songs come random times boring plot if you can even call boring indistinguishable flat characters harley quinn annoying jared leto did his best joker but had absolutely nothing work he just appears random times few seconds disappears theres no depth no story if youve seen trailers you basically saw all oneliners money shots,1
Suicide Squad,if all isnt enough last third movie simply unwatchable,6
Suicide Squad,i dont think david ayer bad director i liked harsh times fury but definitely his worst movie yet im pretty sure its due massive pressure producers,3
Suicide Squad,film utterly lacked any substance there promise beginning great opening introducing us antiheroes which awesome then nothing stranded such talented cast fighting comical looking goons anticlimax villian two stars viola davis margot robbie who give their roles everything every other character disposable forgettable jared leto joker lets say no more,4
Suicide Squad,disappointment thats actually far better than what i felt after watching movie i wanted leave cinema about 30 minutes before end but thats against my personal policy so i tried plan b but found nothing poke my eyes out so i watched cried,1
Suicide Squad,name,2
Suicide Squad,second what false publicity joker appeared lot trailer but he has absolutely no purpose movie apart being background story harley quinn really you remove him you get same movie but only half theatre full,2
Suicide Squad,third while im her guys who made movie obviously didnt get relationship between harley joker joker dont give damn about her she his tool he can throw her bridge without second thought while harley has developed serious stockholm syndrome toward him movie they all loveydovey end movie i nearly expected see them leave car just married written back they lived happily ever after,3
Suicide Squad,first half movie actually not bad villains really look act like villains most time but everything started fall apart after will smith reunite his troops after they failed mission first time each one them just want drop everything leave but then will smith says they cant give up course all bad guys listen him because he will smith god when i did my first facepalm,1
Suicide Squad,movie 50 will smith 40 harley quinn 10 others really apart first two others just background characters make comparison guardian galaxy you got one hero but you know background stories every members team they get their fair share screen time movie they just dont care,5
Suicide Squad,jokes sorry jokes well i think quotes speaks themselves sometimes its funny most times its not sometimes they even try explain joke you understand but dont find funny i think warner tried more funny less dark movie after they got some bad reviews about batman vs superman being too dark but thats just ridiculous they remade some scenes add jokes sometimes even breaks action,5
Suicide Squad,while im batman vs superman had impact dc universe starts consequences what happened man steel end world has changed movie there no progression dc universe feels more like one those filler episode you dont want watch any series,3
Suicide Squad,i wont talk about end movie because sadist i want you go watch movie suffer during two hours needed finally reach end credits just know last minutes actually way worse than rest movie enjoy,6
Suicide Squad,anyway dc fan i wanted see harley quinn movie but certainly not one i really really really hope warner wont use movie reference make justice league because if they do ill have formulate official request dc so they can let marvel do their movies d see you all 2017,1
Suicide Squad,trying keep up plot movie like chasing moving train except even when you think youve caught up youre not sure you want get board,6
Suicide Squad,someone who went into movie tempered expectations thanks negative critical reviews yet also hope would have some redeeming moments due overall positive imdb user reviews i can honestly say critics may have won one,1
Suicide Squad,suicide squad has number issues but not total loss comic book fans performances actors not what stops film being success but doesnt stop their characters going wrong direction,1
Suicide Squad,1 plot plot pretty much mess common complaint about batman v superman movie plot defied logic had too much trivial subplot due amount characters suicide squad runs into similar problem i feel like they compensated logic simply include scenes would satisfy comic book fans however its sake films success whole nothing ever explained you want explained somehow movie confusing blend predictable yet unclear i found myself constantly asking why wouldnt you just do,1
Suicide Squad,2 not enough screen time other squad members rest squad other than harley deadshot not fleshed out well movies feeble attempts add background dimension complexity characters fails flashbacks random monologues dont elicit any sort empathy viewer i found myself easily not caring about squad its success all example point 6,6
Suicide Squad,3 pacing i think attempts flesh out characters failed also because way movie paced its about 2 hours yet feels like 30 minute movie scenes jump around quickly what they do choose drag out flashbacks amongst other things may fun watch but unnecessary,1
Suicide Squad,3 overuse music little more nitpicky yet nonetheless something i noticed now im every character having cool theme soundtracks great but suicide squad utilizes loud distracting constant music over dialogue over key scenes music accompanies everything least thats what felt like dont get me wrong sometimes works,1
Suicide Squad,4 there no stakes involved when youre fighting monsters made goop i worried about antagonists movie when i saw trailers none fight scenes have any real tension meaning because type monsters theyre fighting faceless cgi magical goop,1
Suicide Squad,5 uneven dynamic power big issue i have movie lot characters seem extremely unnecessary frankly misplaced due disparity power between all them batman v superman people worried about how batman would stand next superman wonder woman apocalypse suicide squad just felt wrong girl bat guy boomerang were even within two feet guy who can breathe fire woman who can tear hole sky you simply dont believe harley example needed group which throws logic film out wack her bat can rip apart monsters when wallers bullets dont pierce them katanas sword not sure if popular opinion but thought definitely occurred me,2
Suicide Squad,6 katana out all characters movie katanas character biggest wasted opportunity boomerang close runner up im not too familiar her character comics but ive looked up couple strips shes speaking english they freaking subtitle her movie she cant even communicate damn squad she could have been character could bond them pretty cool but shes reduced nonenglish speaking body guard films attempts humanize her couldnt more ineffective i had hoped character would utilized stronger better,1
Suicide Squad,7 joker i never thought id say my lifetime but film should not have included joker he should have full gotten his own movie only been certain scenes jared leto does great job hes definitely scene stealer fact i could see people leaving movie thinking he best part only redeeming quality which my mind actually will smith but i did enjoy watching joker but his appearances made no sense context plot felt fairly forced random i expecting complex schemes him maybe interesting sub plot but thats not what i got movie,2
Captain Marvel,cgi over power doesnt make good film like marvel version justice league she could just fly through whatever she wants destory there wasnt any display fight iq heart something you see captain america iron man just girl who won over power lottery without any character depth,1
Captain Marvel,film,1
Captain Marvel,captain marvel doesnt have any impact endgame movie without her wont change bit so its not good movie anyway,1
Captain Marvel,ive liked brie larson other films but she showed zero range when your main character superhero movie unwatchable you already have problem addition captain marvel has no weaknesses which kills tension immediately there no point which you feel she any danger losing any danger all matter,4
Captain Marvel,its ok origin story but makes no sense why shes supposedly so powerful,3
Captain Marvel,cat good,1
Captain Marvel,i am marvel fan i go see all movies then buy blurays i have character statues posters have read comics including captain marvel there reason people become fans certain things those things done well over time generate more fans until becomes juggernaut like mcu has i fear its not unstoppable however subpar captain marvel has painfully illustrated movie pastiche poorly written scenes bit uninspired action sprinkled here there barely any plot all carol danvers has no character development whatsoever no adversity overcome besides amnesia no villain fight i know there people saying they like movie but i feel like they either arent being honest they like personal reasons not present movie objectively speaking terms technical aspects storytelling captain marvel just isnt effective subjectively i bored entire time nostalgia parts made me feel though jj abrams poking me ribs asking me if i member 90s yes yes i do record people criticizing movie because bad not because they haaaate wooomans dismissing legitimate criticisms using tactic will not produce better films which only thing most people want problem they built movie around idea strong woman promoted identity film so when movie ends up being bad some people rush defend because they dont want idea fail movie itself secondary just vehicle slap their bumper stickers which real shame because could have been great addition mcu i hope they learn something but what ive heard appears marvel actually plans escalate identity politics next phase which would absolute disaster them when pointing box office defense how good captain marvel just remember tons paying customers didnt like all,1
Captain Marvel,overhyped very underwhelming sadly ranks alongside incredible hulk otherwise incredible mcu does not bode well avengers endgame phase 4 if path marvel going down,1
Captain Marvel,boring storyline so poor script writing feel asleep during film marvel whatever you doing please stop take bit more time into thought process what could been great movie,1
Captain Marvel,her performance forced uninspiring flat not looking forward next movie her,4
Captain Marvel,i really really wanted love movie but just didnt do me all i dont want run others but what hell studiosproducerwriters casting directors kool aid first ant man wasp now you lay poop us i watched because im marvel fan didnt want miss any juicy details leading up end game but no just no youre better off streaming online saving your money maybe then disney will get their act together,1
Captain Marvel,i left general feeling captain marvel major disappointment,4
Captain Marvel,first all there good story here somewhere but its just not well told theres too much crammed within about 115 minutes movie fastpaced but never really works because pacing flat timing off aesthetically captain marvel has been processed through same marvel filter rest them dull filmmakers indie directors great half nelson have given absolutely no attention music score completely forgettable 90s songs,1
Captain Marvel,themes mgtow people going have field day captain marvels less than subtle feminist agenda im putting quotations because its more accurately described simply female agenda which absolutely fine commendable problem infantile inyourface way filmmakers address theme movie set year 1995 really feels made years audience captain marvel lacks fresh perspective way any fans buffy vampire slayer will immediately recognise one pivotal scene lifted truly powerful scene series finale any case carol danvers comics always decidedly feminist character so shouldnt cause any waves whats lacking carols wide array problems her character history comics one craziest marvel universe which saying something movies much simpler,2
Captain Marvel,biggest disappointment however resourceful brie larson shes just off i dont know what happened but brilliant actress room nowhere seen she just wrong choice i guess still im surprised her lacklusterness cast isnt great anyways but least samuel l jackson ben mendelsohn seem having fun,2
Captain Marvel,unlike me most part,4
Captain Marvel,wife wanted see im marvel fan so i thought would good idea watch date night long story short we both left theater disappointed acting story flow sucked,8
Captain Marvel,i live indonesia ive just seen since aired today action scenes good deaging early shield agents great i cant really notice seeing fury thats those good things about movie brie larson comes off snobbish when she quips like tony stark but became boring unlikeable more she does there moments action scenes when its all cgi looks like came ps3 game comedy subpar worth nose exhale least,8
Captain Marvel,quote laura clifford captain marvel boring mishmash ideas score other movies franchises,5
Captain Marvel,bad acting bad script bad directing just bad overall seemed like i watching some cliche movie made freshman college way too much money but not enough skills pull off,1
Captain Marvel,very controversial marvel film which seems running trend disney films recently hype around film seems very mixed some want succeed some want fail both sides seem have these viewpoints due various political reasons there seems lot agendas involved i do not have any stake either side because i do not care about kind thing when comes film i dont think its fair judge films perspective positive negative way same sense i dont think its fair judge film positive negative perspective based whether not you like actors involved i dont care if films succeed fail financially film art form me i just want see films wellmade people who have lot passion their craft,3
Captain Marvel,start things i liked theres some spurts entertainment come film some fun action scenes chemistry between brie larson samuel jackson very point deaging effects samuel jackson clark gregg were surprisingly great first act overall relatively enjoyable especially opening action scene musicscore pretty good cat fun addition but overall film very bland disappointing,3
Captain Marvel,honestly i hoping better me superhero movie needs have interesting story well developed characters needs grab me make me care about whats going applies film general one saddest things about film i genuinely hoping i wouldnt have say i dont think brie larson did good job film brie larson incredibly talented actress so i dont necessarily think shes blame might have just been poor material she given work film progresses she gets increasingly more stoic film never showcases any emotion vulnerability towards character some reason her character given almost all backstory too much exposition very little depth same time there isnt enough given make you care about her any characters overall i dont think she fit character performance very wooden uneven which sad say because you can tell how much passion shes giving towards character,6
Captain Marvel,narrative so scattered she kind gets lost shuffle they forget develop her character which disappointing me storytelling very messy film trying origin story connecting piece past well whats going now set up film whats come later so film kind collapsed itself because its trying do too many things once,1
Captain Marvel,honestly felt like phase 1 which not good thing thats not say iron man avengers werent good its just film feels lot like early marvel films sense felt like they were still experimental phase they were still trying figure out what works what doesnt work about their films theyve passed point they know what works now so film well all other new ones should progressive steps forward film definitely gigantic step backwards,1
Saving Private Ryan,my grandfather fought ww2 somehow surviving dday he apart operation neptune stormed beaches normandy he told us lot war stories but rarely ever spoke about day before he passed away he did interview local newspaper detailed what he saw despite being very difficult him speak about he loved watching war movies not sure exactly why some about soldier life never really leaves them i guess he absolutely hated pearl harbor cause horrible way they portray military bunch toothbrush wielding babies who dont know what do event being attacked he had friend stationed there who lost his life thinks movie disgusting display ignorance soldiers dont take girlfriends private plane rides they most definitely know how swim maybe ill give movie good ripping one day,10
Saving Private Ryan,but saving private ryan respectable i cant watch reaction he said no movie has come close capturing what day like he said too realistic whether not story based real fiction intro 100 realistic im not sure if he ever did finish watching but he appreciated capturing chaos like no other movie has before i watched movie dozen times now keep my collection reminder my grandfather scene he technically which makes me appreciate how strong person he really,10
Saving Private Ryan,war hell movie not only shows while being entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers left behind my grandfather not afraid anything ive seen man walk into cellar full black widows get firewood not even shake them off only time he ever experienced fear when he went bed his nightmares his time during war would haunt him his sleep movie helped me understand why,10
Saving Private Ryan,possibly most realistic depiction gruesome war shown film spielbergs yet another addition his perfect films collection i got emotional during last scene film really makes you feel character story goes tom hanks character tasked find save only ryan brother all his other brothers kia hanks performance soldier world war 2 possibly most realistic shows horrors troops saw during assaults matt damon ryan also very good he relatively young which adds how young soldiers were sent hell fight japs last scene really hit heart me creates best emotional resonance incredible special effects really show true gritty reality war film not like previous classic war movies such where eagles dare guns navarone where they somewhat glorify being war saving private ryan among greatest spielberg today there have been similar gritty movies war such fury hacksaw ridge but me better than those overall i highly recommend seeing obviously take into count lengthy running time but well worth,9
Saving Private Ryan,first 23 minutes film rated 12,10
Saving Private Ryan,my good friend i took our sons 17 time see theater i am senior military officer who experienced combat 1967 68 69 we wanted boys see horror war slaughter,10
Saving Private Ryan,i have had pack up personal effects my comrade send back his mother after he killed viet nam war those you who have not done cannot even comprehend,9
Saving Private Ryan,after opening combat scenes film 8 well done,10
Saving Private Ryan,war hell those us who have been there well i dont know what say,10
Saving Private Ryan,neither our sons joined military thank god,9
Saving Private Ryan,i know its fashionable trash successful movies but least honest about trashing pvt ryan fiction but pretty good historical fiction details were well thought out based reality,10
Saving Private Ryan,there nothing stupid about portrayal german army rommel did blunder his placement force high command did think calais going invasion spot not normandy hitler didnt wake up until noon day his aides were afraid wake him rangers did come right behind first wave did take beach exit sheer will get hell off beach bluffs were scene heavy close fighting german defenders were mostly eastern european conscripts defeated areas note 2 men tried surrender were not speaking german there young man rescued interior normandy after his brothers were all killed he airborne trooper difference he found chaplain removed front,10
Saving Private Ryan,battles inside normandy were small actions town town street street house house small actions like taking radar station happened small actions like handful men defending river bridge against odds happened small squads men formed out misdrops banded together ad hoc fight there were all enlisted groups all officer groups general did die glider assault fubar aptly described much what happened day,10
Saving Private Ryan,there were only americans movie because brits canadians were many klicks away different area omaha beach story american one monty did bog down advance everyone knew american stereotypes well those pretty much define america my college roomie wiseass new york jew my best friend second generation east coast sicilian my college girlfriend third generation german my first wife french english im irish my boss norwegian i work navaho you get point,10
Saving Private Ryan,so much being bad history fact excellent way let jaded somewhat ignorantoftheirpast generation feel something what their grandparents living grandparents went through perhaps less important details exact feel right even now details not fully known knowable about campaign too big too complex too chaotic knowable there not even accurate casualty count dday itself,10
Saving Private Ryan,now depth characters what i saw there extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown what happened them i saw things would mark generation i have heard my elderly male patients sentiments similar what cpt miller expressing when he announced his ordinariness i saw dehumanization occurs war its mitigation moment moment man man cpt miller didnt know anything about ryan he didnt care until ryan revealed his humanity him his story his brothers pvt reiban ready walk out situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness his humanity then he began look him almost father pvt mellish rightfully delights his revenge all times hes had take because he jewish telling german captives hes juden nerdish cpl upham can stand alongside his bigger stronger braver ranger compatriots describe poetry melancholy edith piafs song then face his cowardice turn around stand up face danger finally demonstrate dehumanization enterprise he enmeshed executing steamboat willie even though willie had no more choice about being there than upham did other circumstances would have made friend,6
Saving Private Ryan,i could go but enough already ok perhaps not best movie ever made but still good movie if one will take blinders fashionable negativism off they will see finally not patriotic story if anything acknowledgement thank you all those old men still out there did so much us them i say deep sincere thank you,10
Saving Private Ryan,id heard couple startling things about film before seeing id heard many veterans were having hard time getting through film without breaking down id also seen interviews veterans whod seen film found film incredibly realistic consequently difficult watch intriguing comments since we all know there no shortage films about war century,10
Saving Private Ryan,there not many films ive seen have actually made me physically react action screen im not speaking threedimensional variety either what i mean say film had me contorting cringing gripping horrifying action screen somehow extreme violence can justified whole world knows important chapter human history startling graphic depiction only adds more weight seriousness subject matter id have say probably one most important films 20th century because its frank approach one darkest periods our time earth,10
Saving Private Ryan,i am always deeply moved fiercely proud when given cause consider those gave their lives protect our way life liberate those already suffered dislocation imprisonment attempted genocide these soldiers were truly noble deserve our deepest gratitude sentiment common one will go some lengths explain why film has meant so much so many,10
Saving Private Ryan,even attention detail care taken into how shot accentuate fullest degree its realistic approach still hard imagine what must have been like part war but film goes long way help your mind get around its hard me say what kind impact cinematography would have someone watching small screen television versus big screen but my perspective film really does benefit theatrical presentation,10
Saving Private Ryan,what saving private ryan does extremely well show world harsh reality war without pulling any punches story about squad soldiers sent retrieve surviving brother three dead soldiers told competency due reverence all perspectives characters involved uncommon intriguing drama but serves excuse describe setting rather than other way around story manages move us through all sorts different landscapes scenarios giving us unforgettable glimpse world unknown most us terrifying those who familiar personal experience,1
Alita: Battle Angel,ill honest when i went into cinema watch movie i expecting not like i had seen little bit trailer did not really speak me alitas eyes were off putting when movie had begun i actually searching things dislike but surprisingly there were none apart few cringeworthy moments i quickly got used alitas eyes they became fact likeable story began draw me i got completely absorbed into story visuals,9
Alita: Battle Angel,world extraordinary beautiful action scenes movie fantastic quite honestly some best i have seen story bit fast paced but not degree feels rushed alita character great she kindhearted innocent naive protective throughout movie alita grows person learns about sacrifice loss love horrors human mind alita very likeable because she such good person such horrible world you cant help feeling very sympathetic innocent being like her she exposed cruel world iron city,9
Alita: Battle Angel,i watched movie without knowing source material i loved i drawn very early had watch second time i can definitely recommend movie anyone,10
Alita: Battle Angel,i really love movie storyline really great exciting start finish graphics really cool its like i didnt wanna blink all plot not mindnumbing critics say well seems like i have stop listening them because film worth watching everyone thank you all people behind movie im sure movie wasnt easy make now i really hope i dont have wait too long sequel,9
Alita: Battle Angel,alita battle angel what happens when hollywood finally get anime film right ive gotta say james cameron robert rodriguez should work more together because film incredible,9
Alita: Battle Angel,film had heart soul poured into its story you could tell 1000 hours work have gone into making film theyve pulled one best films year incredible visual effects cgi work give film beautiful setting background,9
Alita: Battle Angel,visual effect alita voiced rosa salazar were incredibly done giving detail her eyes which made her character screen look more like actual human actress her character acting what made film they give her human soul purpose writing which so well done gives audience emotional journey young woman trying discover who she,9
Alita: Battle Angel,love interest side film so done right doesnt feel forced well which along its action sequences well supporting cast nothing short perfect story does great job not revealing too much earlier slowly building up characters so you understand story draws you into every moment matched awesome fight scenes great formidable villains film adding incredible film,9
Alita: Battle Angel,one those films deserves sequel successful film what theyve realised here one best live action anime films damn near perfect if slight pacing issue doesnt really affect film but noticeable,8
Alita: Battle Angel,does live up hype hell yes film live up hype must watch teh big screen hopefully were see sequel come because so needs,7
Alita: Battle Angel,dislikes only flaw i spotted ive said there slight issue pacing not affects film any way but noticeable,10
Alita: Battle Angel,i loved movie alita battle angel my type movie i love science fiction great action throughout entire movie also has very substantive story solid foundation setting very grim but alitas character uplifting gives viewers hope i liked how alitas story also involves quest finding out who she truly she finds herself world where she can seen somewhat ordinary but she comes find out shes far ordinary shes angel heaven i really enjoyed movie story itself can explained further other films i hope theres sequel ending laid framework more films movie emotional action filled has intense action sequences creators film did nice job spacing out action they didnt rush into every battle scene meaningful i would definitely recommend movie,10
Alita: Battle Angel,im 47 year old man who went film school i loved movie theres no point trying dissect what alita battle angel got right wrong terms script pacing character development whatever else film snobs like blather about just fun actionpacked first installment what i hope will least trilogy if not more they couldnt have cast alita more perfectly even if her onscreen form completely digital great movie tons fun dont overthink,9
Alita: Battle Angel,ive always loved anime its always been frustrating watching hollywood movies destroy ghost shell alita however did amazing job fusing hollywood anime i believe great story adaptation james cameron breathtaking action scenes directing rodriguez great casting i saw 4dx 3d seoul roller coaster ride i afraid movie might put me sleep but kept me engaged watching beginning end i think most important element movies should ability engage audience never let them go until very end movie delivers also i am very proud director rodriguez taking enormous task he put lot line make film interesting thing i found some reason i felt there were elements john carpenter here overall one best 3d films made so far i believe bar has been pushed higher all filmmakers must watch 3d exerpience,9
Alita: Battle Angel,marvelous effect some great actions make movie not missed seeing big screen but thing i love most alita herself there were few times i had smile myself watching alita she so loveable badass really really hope will goes beyond just one movie world building alita so fascinating course need see more alita,9
Alita: Battle Angel,but romance threw us off bit but way much better than ghost shell ready player one story amazing made sense didnt jump one element another pasting perfect visuals stunning absolutely 1010 but romanceeveryone cinema giggled when hugo died just didnt work nobody cared about character anyway he simply there have love interest alita summing up definitely worth watching looking forward next one,10
Alita: Battle Angel,longtime fan gunnmbattle angel alita i am satisfied i appreciate production team took their time do research original serials adaptation great they filtered out few acquire taste swapped elements would make much more appeal general public film really kept true original manga reassembled almost everything manga scenes mechanical bodies characters world they lived they did great job capturing alitas slightly naïve stubbornness all all out euthanasic pursuit who she storywise film ingeniously weaved first 11 books manga together brought up few events happening 2nd chapter alitas adventure 1st movie which nice since i bet theyre already thinking next alita movie but few camerons work dark side ugliness irontown wasnt rendered enough lack depth ugliness made whole plot bit light emotional conflict wasnt intense enough romance plotline which very important 1st chapter little bit lack depth overall cg stunning other than wanted flyer parasites face rest cg absolute marvelous all all definite great gunnm movie will definite watch again again till sequel out,10
Alita: Battle Angel,coming producing mind james cameron alita battle angel one most visually impressive films recent memory though doesnt necessarily have script go along those dazzling visuals rosa salazar fantastic titular alita once again proves she deserves more starring roles hollywood problem lies screenplay cringe worthy romance underdeveloped characters but very least its fun action film universe i would love see more films take place,9
Alita: Battle Angel,7510,8
Alita: Battle Angel,i will not stand presence evil inspiring line spoken protagonist alita battle angel when facing indomitable frightening villain got me thinking i will not stand presence clueless movie critics giving lukewarm reviews excellent movie hence my motivation writing review film i consider great visionary triumph such groundbreaking special effects not experienced since avatar worldbuilding dazzling last years critically acclaimed blade runner 2049,10
Alita: Battle Angel,based manga kishiro creative combo rodriguez cameron have created world so technically stunning cinematically immersive stirred delighted my soul during whole movie,10
Alita: Battle Angel,its heart alita tantalizing adventure about teenage self discovery self fulfillment although disguised plot which stated protagonist 300 yearold alien berserker story combines science fiction martial arts dystopian future fight scenes well choreographed say matrix but avoid over indulging extended repetitive fight sequences theres lot exposition fitted into 2hour movie hence some scenes seemed truncated order story advance accordingly,10
Alita: Battle Angel,said plot has familiar elements made new but more interesting ways elements world constantly being monitored borrow heavily hunger games adrenaline infusing motorball acting game action scenes thrilling times violent but explained earlier never over indulges when such scenes short i found myself wanting more hence repeat viewing ensues,3
Alita: Battle Angel,film ends somewhat cliffhanger fanboys like me hoping against pessimistic box office forecast movie will make enough money warrant 2 more sequels complete overarching story one most interesting female characters one most visually arresting imaginative energetic science fiction movies all time,10
Alita: Battle Angel,go watch alita battle angel highly recommended,10
The Assistant,watch she makes coffee watch she makes copies watch she sweeps crumbs watch she empties wastebasket watch she changes travel plans someone else watch she almost scrambles when usual driver cant pick her boss up watch she makes more copies watch she heats tv dinner every second its microwave i wish i kidding ive worked over 60 films spent lot time working production offices has absolute dullest film subject ive ever seen lead appears have some talent but shes allowed exactly one note okay maybe one half watch she plays extra half note impromptu visit hr watch she smokes cigarette after,2
The Assistant,just dont expect anything happen also seriously dont watch,1
The Assistant,trailer film misleading promoted thriller but absolutely not drama maybe but not even more like old news documentary didnt add anything new topic we thought thriller there might something else beyond trailer but trailer actually entire movie absolutely waste time such scam,1
The Assistant,watching someone work all day not entertaining,1
The Assistant,about most boring movie all time no love no laughter no suspense simply movie about most miserable unimaginative people ever main star did great job what she had work withwhich basically nothing even one invested even dollar movie can expect loss,2
The Assistant,i love julia fell love her during ozark although she played character well movie itself just wasnt what had potential when i tell you every single person theater went wait what its over i am not exaggerating we all stayed until after credits were done discuss felt ended way too abruptly without diving deeper not seeing her boss fine but we all felt like there barely plot yes we all understood producer sleazeball but could have been more depth maybe more story about what happened little miss boise very anticlimactic,7
The Assistant,first off movie does make number thinly veiled references harvey weinstein,2
The Assistant,however do not expect see much harvey movie,2
The Assistant,do not expect sort harvey dearest exploitation piece walltowall scenes movie executive who obviously supposed harvey weinstein abusing raping employees left right,1
The Assistant,additionally do not expect something along lines all presidents men erin brockovich which plucky young heroine brings down powerful but very corrupt individual,1
The Assistant,what you can expect see very accurate depiction typical day typical employee amidst silent chaos someone like harvey weinsteins reign terror,2
The Assistant,finally you can expect very competent answer question exactly how individuals such weinstein bill cosby got away what they did long they did,6
The Assistant,i mean didnt anyone know,1
The Assistant,well assistant answers question relentless presentation over exposition they didnt get away because no one knew they got away because everyone knew anyone who has been witness sort thing knows thats exactly how happens behavior simply becomes part every day life organization thereon no one will say anything because entire organization becomes extension bosss behavior,3
The Assistant,its not fun movie but honest one,10
The Assistant,film looks great but absolutely nothing consequence happens moves glacial pace assistants life misery ok we get no hint story whatever producersdirectorwriter were after they missed mark,6
The Assistant,i may shallow but nothing more than boring day boring life boring executive assistant i think they picked boringest day ever might have been two days doesnt matter so boring might have been week,2
The Assistant,first off i rarely review movies but felt need post warning 40 years watching movies ive never given movie 1 star only redeeming part movie had mercy viewers ran under 90 minutes,9
The Assistant,movie about nothing what disappointment we really like julia garner ozark but she couldnt save student film,8
The Assistant,term casting couch has been around ever we all know about beast harvey weinstein topic broached more entertainingly morning show dont listen critics reviews save your time watching paint dry grass grow going through old tax info,1
The Assistant,dont say you werent warned,1
The Assistant,trailer most entertaining part drawn out boring indulgent snorefest i think i would rather pull my own teeth out without anasthetic than watch excuse film,1
The Assistant,first 15minutes movie absolutely nothing happens its deader than dead sea but i stuck movie thinking would eventually pick up something interesting would happen there would like freeking aliens hidden somewhere something but none happened didnt pick up nothing interesting happened there were no aliens,1
The Assistant,i dont hardly ever say but movie wasted 90minutes my life i literally regret watching movie thats how needlessly timewasting movie,1
The Assistant,end i honestly dont even know what movie about literally nothing happened bring movie close girl still works company her boss still does what he does everything stays same nothing changed i just dont get what point movie,1
Spartacus,most undoubtedly aware film director virtually expunged his repertoire but why did stanley kubrick really disown spartacus 1960 answer can summed up two words absolute control kubrick wanted total administrative well artistic authority over making film about revolt gladiators slaves ancient rome,9
Spartacus,but you will notice bryna productions not only financed spartacus but also earlier film directed kubrick paths glory 1958 bryna kirk douglas film company most filmgoers know he star both films besides having all money make films douglas had artistic vision well only three weeks into what would prove incredibly complex arduous production douglas fired venerable director anthony mann raw deal railroadedthe furies naked spur man laramie man west etc spartacus only two days notice kubrick hired replace him,10
Spartacus,shooting paths glory douglas had confined his criticisms objections kubricks failed rewriting script they went original screenplay douglas complaints artistic influence were far greater spartacus much kubricks chagrin though director craved autonomy over every aspect film douglas would not budge tense compromise reached but ultimately douglas had last word kubrick saw himself just hired gun he would never allow himself placed position again,8
Spartacus,later both men would complain about films outcome each other they never made another movie together,10
Spartacus,but spartacus no uneven patchwork divergent ideas film cohesive arresting restored version three hours eighteen minutes there practically no dead footage film dalton trumbos screenplay surprisingly economical sharply drawn characters placed against sweeping historical majesty violent sociological tumult ancient rome quite plainly gloriously inventive music alex north among greatest scores ever written motion picture despite kubricks bad experience he managed guide actors towards creating outstanding work best supporting actor oscar peter ustinov he even transformed very real enmity between laughton olivier into onscreen asset his other contributions were considerable also large scale power battle sequence example end film least clash giant egos proved fortuitous recommendations greater insight detail kubricks other films i urge you seek out jan harlans excellent documentary stanley kubrick life pictures vincent lobruttos exhaustive highly informative biography stanley kubrick producers views spartacus its director take gander kirk douglas very candid autobiography ragmans son,10
Spartacus,what little ive read film lucky have been made all some very big talents had some very big egos those egos clashed repeatedly original director anthony mann replaced stanley kubrick producerstar kirk douglas among other clashes,10
Spartacus,but result all worth stars all give top notch performances but mark really great film memorability each individual ensemble give few examples charles mcgraw sadistic trainer gladiatorial school john dall sir laurence oliviers protégé john ireland kirk douglass fellow gladiator trainee all memorable brief roles they have,8
Spartacus,kirk douglas wisely opts straightforward interpretation hero title role spartacus hes bc everyman born into world which hadnt heard anything about human rights he knows feels hes not just cattle catch alternating scenes douglas sir laurence olivier addressing slave army roman army olivier his years shakespearean training coming across tyrant douglas simple prose talking about slaves fighting their hopes dreams very effective,8
Spartacus,plot concerns revolt gladiatorial school which mushrooms into crisis roman empire political factions led olivier crassus charles laughton gracchus seek use slave revolt further their own ends,9
Spartacus,laughton always wonder its bit unusual casting him because his parts usually those very tortured souls his gracchus sly rogue but decent man one my favorite movie lines all time delivered him addressing roman senate where he says hell take little republican corruption little republican freedom,8
Spartacus,another sly rogue film peter ustinov who won first his two oscars batiatus owner gladiatorial school like so many others im sure those days hes just trying come out winning side when doing so could life death situation,9
Spartacus,jean simmons varinia beloved spartacus has only womans part any substance but when ms simmons bad anything one most underrated underappreciated actresses history film,10
Spartacus,lessons about mans desire freedom control his own destiny eternal valid film will also,10
Spartacus,kubricks farewell hollywood i would have liked fly wall i dont believe minute cordial parting ways i mean kubrick never returned never paths glory kubrick gave kirk douglas not just his best part actor but his best movie time douglas called kubrick take over spartacus douglas already huge star too much saying matter look its clear spartacus more douglas than kubrick great fun watch yes absolutely terrific script black listed dalton trumbo some fight sequences unequalled history film look fight between douglas woody strode compare ones troy gladiator matter sad embarrassing realise how low weve fallen computer generated images not cast unbelievable but its clearly not kubricks casting his movies part his master plan he would cast ryan oneil barry lyndon instance so he can blend perfectly magnificent tapestry without adding any colours his own same can said keir dullea 2001 robotic non entity showdown voice when he needed actors very pinnacle his universe he went peter sellers malcolm mcdowell james mason even casting tom cruise made lot sense he used star his wife talk about dreamlike powers betrayal spartacus tony curtis plays antoninus teacher classics campy idea never seen kubrick film before since fair there some spot brilliant pieces casting charles laughton usual superb peter ustinov terrific laurence olivier manages give multifaceted portrait weakness fear greed jean simmons makes reason survive totally believable but cutesy love scene between her shiny muscular coiffed spartacus truly terrible final blow scene enveloped sticky corny music theme having said all dont you dare missing epic its kubricks goodbye hollywood like everything else master said do he really meant,5
Spartacus,darkest historical epic no dancing girls no chariot races filmed sombre browns reds nominally directed kubrick but douglas very hands producer responsable operatic sweep film i astonished when revisiting film 1991 cinema bravery projectto have hero cry several times once even out self pity heart rending ending film has depth weight characters well drawn performances almost flawless douglas managing actor create tension each sceneolivier not withstanding his eyerolling mannerisms perfectly cast minor parts richly drawngravel voiced charles mcgraw herbert lom woody strode cinematography music flawless only john dall very modern glaberus john ireland crixus seem out place ironically despite downbeat tone film impossible watch without being uplifted through your tears compassion unofficialy remade braveheartwatch one after other youll see similarities mood theme even battle choreography spartacus would my desert island movie,4
Spartacus,widely acclaimed his serious ambitions his uncompromising perfectionism stanley kubrick has won himself unique degree artistic freedom,9
Spartacus,based true story slave revolt 73 bc dalton trumbos script mixes melodrama some quite moving moments film depicts roman era brutality slave system gladiator combat decadence roman senators what emerges screen passionate statement behalf freedom men who willing die overthrow oppressive governments,9
Spartacus,credit films style belongs stanley kubrick who handles scenes intimacy scenes gigantic sweep equal attention illustrating violence brutality corruption both masters slaves raising question freedom which justify human cost,10
Spartacus,kirk douglas plays spartacus idealistic noble slave who believes he must struggle forever against tyranny just opposing tyranny he inspires his followers his example,9
Spartacus,spartacus character violent primitive rebel who hamstrung foreman his teeth into gladiator who fought desperately life arena into revolutionary able unite amorphous mass slaves deserters into force which succeeded defeat romes best trained armies into charismatic leader vision who forces longawaited revolt against roman empire,9
Spartacus,two political rivals crassus gracchus use slave uprising threat manipulate roman senate their own ends,4

The Godfather: Part II,coppolas masterpiece rivaled only godfather part ii which 1940s setting first movie extended backwards forwards reveal corrupting effect powerthe film breathtaking its scope tragic grandeur shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods early career young vito corleone seen first around turn 20th century sicily then 1917 building his criminal underworld italian ghettos new york city post world war i plus his son michael al pacino desperately trying keep his family together,10
The Godfather: Part II,al pacinos performance quiet solemn he cold ruthless whole contrast idealistic innocent war hero we initially met beginning first film here hes calculating frightening force seeking expand casinos into prerevolutionary cuba consolidating empire surrounded perfidy treason maintaining total confidence his ability control situation whether testifying before enraging senators trying outface his worst enemies,10
The Godfather: Part II,films haunting final shot lonely isolated paranoid michael his empty compound unforgettable movie scene tragic portrait lonely fully damned person emotionally empty finished far waspish wife more distant faithful lawyer,10
The Godfather: Part II,de niros rise orphan child family feud back italy hood new york his position respected don provides welcome break pacinos relentless attitude since people he kills seem deserve vito comes off better than michael does wise coppola shuffle two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks disturbance continuity,10
The Godfather: Part II,entire cast contributes greatly success film lee strasberg fascinating mixture lust ruthlessness g d spradlin absolutely right sinister corrupt nevada senator michael v gazzo unforgettable troubled grayhaired informer gastone moschin excellent blackmailer white suit john cazale marvelously timid vague confused hesitant fredo diane keaton clearly irrational longsuffering wife kay talia shire too extravagant lousy mother troy donahue too ambitious fortunehunting suitor robert duvall excels confidant retainer allpowerful corleone family,10
The Godfather: Part II,coppolas motion picture not just mere supply new characters events original its far more complex intimate movie than its predecessor not really sequel its just more cleverly shifts time between two distinct narratives extreme realistic violence criminal mentality gangsters,10
The Godfather: Part II,godfather part ii very suspenseful drama very exciting story great acting great special effects i would definitely recommend you watch moviebut first watch original classic 1972 godfather movie may not good first movie but still amazing sequel,10
The Godfather: Part II,movie way good labelled sequel godfather rather more companion piece original two perfectly compliment each other both sequel prequel showing rise young vito moral decline micheal both characters brought life uncanny ability robert deniro al pacino say these two good actors like saying nuclear bomb makes loud noise movie they prove why they top their respective crafts,10
The Godfather: Part II,al pacino standout ensemble cast its amazing how his eyes have changed first part they now cold ruthless unemotional betray price which micheal corleone has paid power,10
The Godfather: Part II,watch movie learn why greatest gangster film all time,10
The Godfather: Part II,original godfather brilliant work sense voyeuristic delight allowing us see mafia inside we become part family singlehandedly change worlds view organized crime created cast sympathetic characters none whom have shred common morality highest grossing movie its time brando created cultural icon whose influence resonates strong today did 1972,10
The Godfather: Part II,extraordinary achievement part ii even better easily receives my nod best picture ever made i have seen least 20 times each time its 200 minutes fly,9
The Godfather: Part II,movie uses flashbacks brilliantly weave two tales main story reign michael corleone worlds most powerful criminal now reaping benefits legalized gambling las vegas michael evident billionaire iron fist world treachery,10
The Godfather: Part II,behind director francis ford coppola spins tale rise michaels father vito center new york mafia these scenes make film work art without spoiling i will simply say robert deniro young vito best acting performance all time role which he won richly deserved oscar,9
The Godfather: Part II,screenplay full delicious little underworld nuggets keep your friends close i dont want kill everyone just my enemies while blows dense twisted plot past you dizzying merciless pace cinematography depressing atmospheric score continues eerie role its predecessor foretelling death evil,10
The Godfather: Part II,all makes movie great infinitely watchable but its whats deeper inside film what really about its true genius,10
The Godfather: Part II,godfather part ii not really movie about mafia movie about mans life long struggle michael controls vast empire constantly slipping out his hands he grows increasingly distrustful paranoid even shows signs he hates his own life michael almost seems resent fact he natural born crime lord man who puts family business ahead everything,10
The Godfather: Part II,great don michael corleone can never come terms one simple fact his fathers empire built love respect michaels empire built fear violent treachery,10
The Godfather: Part II,see movie its threeandahalf hours very well spent,10
The Godfather: Part II,godfather part 2 finest sequel ever made arguably finer film than original godfather film divided into two main parts story young vito corleone flawlessly acted robert de niro worthy oscar winner rise power michael head family francis coppola recollaborated many crew members first film again achieves quite superb period piece thanks cinematography gordon willis set design dean tavoularis acting performances outstanding hence three supporting oscar nominations acting guru lee strasberg hyman roth michael gazzo frank pentangeli robert de niro young vito corleone duvall keaton cazale shire all provided first rate performances but performance al pacino which steals show expertly portraying michael cool calculating suspicious don corleone film expands upon original movie brings us into familys activities nevada florida havana arguably finest movie 70s cinematic masterpiece greatest ensemble acting you will probably see,9
The Godfather: Part II,must watch everybody backstory godfather cant decided if part 1 2 better both beyond amazing,10
The Godfather: Part II,godfather part ii excellent just like its predecessor while first arguably greatest film ever made second installment easily best sequel produced hands down film split between stories michael corleone al pacino oscarnominated young vito corleone robert de niro his starmaking first oscarwinning performance 1950s michael trying expand his crime empire locales such las vegas hollywood even turbulent cuba however there numerous problems older brother fredo john cazale may have doublecrossed family also two prominent crime bosses pose considerable threat well lee strasberg michael v gazzo both oscarnominated younger sister connie oscar nominee talia shire still reeling her husbands murder her fathers death conclusion original film michael also distancing himself his wife diane keaton some his most trusted friends robert duvall while all occurring we get glimpses into early life michaels father de niro we learn his parents older brother have been killed early1900s sicily he has immigrated new york vito pays his dues learns tricks trade buying his time before deciding create his own small empire which would course grow become what we saw original would seem film would confusing jumping back forth between michael his father but not so coppola gives you just enough information keep audience intrigued through each segment film very wellmade runs very smoothly even though lasts over 200 minutes many think installment best series even though i still think original best i cannot totally disagree assertion definitive sequel 5 stars out 5,10

Heat,1010 my all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece michael mann film all time movie kicks ass,10
Heat,heat film epic proportions common placed scale provides all essentials great crime drama then some fascinating storyline involving characters manns sometimes poetic sometimes gritty directing heat arguably one best crime dramas,6
Heat,perhaps most unique feature movie its manifold storyline which focuses primarily main characters vincent hanna neil mccauley because complex storyline almost seems if one watching two movies one about each two characters while following hannas personal life movie shows how about more than just cop pursuit criminal hannas marriage deteriorating his step daughter falling apart wife justine says he lives his life more among remnants dead people man two other failed marriages hannas story strain trying fulfill both his professional personal where every time professional wins out neil mccauleys story man who used know his role his job everything his life revolved around making next score whether large small his story chronicles his relationships other men his crew his relationship eady his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him tensions build mann shows two opposing strategies each man their paths thus their stories draw closer together when two storylines do meet different points movie result isfor lack better wordepic say these two major storylines only strong ones movie would do injustice many others following chris his wife example but say they driving force movie say they responsible transforming typical copsandrobbers story best explanation,8
The Karate Kid,i being child 80s have soft spot movie yes predictablebut what makes great movie performances 2 main characters ralph macchio great teenager bullied his new school but movie belongs pat morita mr myagi he plays old apartment maintenance man befriends macchio he becomes his karate teacher but they develop great friendship makes movie all more enjoyable great thing movie shows old man comes need kid much kid needs him touching relationship all rest standard rocky film stuff but what rocky film have common characters people we care so all climactic scene stuff works,9
The Karate Kid,lot posts focus coming age aspect movie but very overlooked part role played helping alleviate many stereotypes very asian phobic america after wwii korea vietnam,10
The Karate Kid,they make point showing miyagi us army uniformand war hero makes references detention camps miyagis family sent horribly dark period american historywhere miyagis wife being sent pregnant where she his unborn child son ultimately die during childbirth there also few scenes which ethnic slurs used rednecks toward miyagi,10
The Karate Kid,taking into light taking fact daniel has no father we know movie name danielsan sounds like danielson helps demonstrate father son bond overlooked much conversation between daniel miyagi about miyagis great father okinawa because miyagi has acquired all knowledge wants share daniel substitutes son miyagi never had miyagi substitutes father daniel doesnt have,8
The Karate Kid,my love karate kid limited fact movie if had been hands more fluorescent director could have turned out lot differently movie we all know love 1984,10
The Karate Kid,directed john g avildsen who also did 1976s rocky another underdog story written robert mark kamen who would later coauthor 2001s kiss dragon luc besson which starred jet li another example martial arts american cinema done right karate kid far best frankly most realistic incorporation martial arts into mainstream american film,7
The Karate Kid,movie came out year before i born only through wordofmouth over time i growing up did i know karate kid even existed i got view film my freshman year high school part class but instructor watered down experience so much movie lost its potency,10
The Karate Kid,now few years later i finally watch movie without any intrusion outside world i find truly marvelous picture thats far better than its many stylized contemporaries ie matrix trilogy which best example trend,10
The Karate Kid,ralph macchio stars daniel larusso new kid picturesque southern california community looks lot like something youd see magazine advertisement daniel makes mistake hitting ali elisabeth shue who unknown him exgirlfriend johnny lawrence william zabka daniel takes pretty brutal beating martial artstrained johnny leaves him scarred but his pride dignity still tact,10
The Karate Kid,number violent clashes johnny his brutal cobra kai martial arts friends continue until daniel saved mr miyagi pat morita karatetrained handyman his apartment building daniel insists mr miyagi teaching him karate so he can compete upcoming martial arts tournament requires daniel undergo some pretty unconventional training wax wax off paint fence side side etc return daniel learns theres lot more karate than just fighting old one shows him way,10
The Karate Kid,karate kid true gem film thats shamefully underrated im glad february 1st year movie finally getting dvd treatment deserves,10
The Karate Kid,macchio convincing daniel bringing number wideranging emotions his role first may seem quite perfunctory opposed being dramatic real star show least minds number critics academy morita mr miyagi he brings grace almost rivaling bruce lee role could have been quite stereotypical but still very moving dramatic,9
The Karate Kid,course whats movie about karate without fights i should note action movie very convincing but not stylized any fashion shape form very downtoearth realistic may course bit turnoff some hardcore fanboys may watch movie thinking itll something like matrix 1999 enter dragon 1973,8
The Karate Kid,fighting here its own style mode action number fights quite brutal especially ones where john kreeses martin kove cobra kai students featured he frequently trains them brutal way no mercy which mr miyagi quick realize not way karate,10
The Karate Kid,karate kid gets perfect 1010,8
The Karate Kid,karate kid tale daniel laruso ralph macchio young man who heels his mothers finding new job uprooted newark new jersey sunny shores california daniels mother has visions new start new life sky limit daniel however quickly finds him west coast holds nothing but hard times,9
The Karate Kid,comforts his rough middleclass neighborhood thousands miles away daniel tries make friends blend welltodo upperclass kids his new home first daniel seems do alright but before long he crosses paths johnny william zabka tough rich leader group karate students who attends daniels new school make matters worse johnny exboyfriend ali elisabeth shue girl daniel pursuing,10
The Karate Kid,enter miyagi noriyuki pat morita aging handyman who works daniels apartment building struggling friends failing fit daniel finds support miyagi after enduring several beatings hands johnny his gang daniel comes learn miyagi fact knows karate following vain attempt speak johnnys karate teacher martin kove about being left alone daniel suddenly entered into allvalley karate tournament where he will attempt win respect johnny his gang have taken,9
The Karate Kid,he trains karate tournament miyagi daniel learns invaluable lessons about life love brought foreground karate story daniels pursuit ali who truly single person who gave new kid chance,10
The Karate Kid,many levels karate kid uplifting movie illustrates how lonely outofplace kid triumphs against odds movie doesnt need computeranimation special effects get its story across but me anyone who loves 80s movies karate kid has appreciated its nostalgia trip back better times reason alone movie classic,10
The Karate Kid,ive enjoyed few movies if any more than karate kid i highly recommend flick anyone who loves touching uplifting story anyone who simply cant get out 80s,10
The Karate Kid,done same director rocky unusual feel good movie became hit 1984 generated two sequels before mania died franchise imploded,9
The Karate Kid,i remember phenomenon 80s yet prolific reviewer imdb now which buffs not same thing voracious eater claymore series i now see film differently,10
X-Men: Days of Future Past,i must admit trailers didnt have me convinced after sour taste jack giant slayer left my mouth i sceptic i really dug matthew vaughns approach first class who had tough task rebooting franchise after lacklustre last stand generic dull xmen origins wolverine i wouldnt have minded him returning all but turns out bryan singer yes i dare speak his name still has few tricks up his sleeve its sheer scale epic storytelling alone days future past fantastic,9
X-Men: Days of Future Past,its shame theres so much controversy surrounding film but i guess whoever chooses deprive himself willingly such pleasure must fully aware he does so his own expense because kind film made me fall love movies first place,9
X-Men: Days of Future Past,yet despite my 10star review its not perfect its not usual suspects mutants how could simply not kind film but i have say pretty much my only gripe movie has too many characters some them dont get enough screen time actually theres not too many characters theres just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again thats half fun all xmen films has most complex plot – also most interesting different timelines tricky do can rather hard follow but thanks very clever script great part logan we never get lost thats best news sorely missed last instalment except hilarious cameo franchise has hugh jackman back him least we do get see lot since he really leads us through film giving his best wolverine performance yet along way if logan can called heart xmen then charles xavier must mind while magneto mystique provide slightly twisted soul seeing them all together again brought broad stupid grin my face which only got broader whenever quicksilver appeared screen reasons you will have find out yourselves,10
X-Men: Days of Future Past,what really sets xmen films apart ever more derivative comicbook adaptations – least far im concerned – i always genuinely cared characters days future past no exception i love loud spectacular action movies much next guy but if i dont get care protagonists – whats point reason i gave 10 stars what so exceptional these days what we get here complex smart fantasyscifi thrillride respects its origins much embraces future while never ever forgetting its first job entertain audience finding perfect rare balance between characterdriven human drama noholdsbarred popcorn action spectacle days future past deserves my 10star rating which first me ive never given 10stars comicbook movie,10
X-Men: Days of Future Past,so my verdict if you like get your minds blown something true heart soul massive mutant film upon you all you have do give xcitement enjoy ride,10
X-Men: Days of Future Past,favorite films httpwwwimdbcomlistls054200841,8
X-Men: Days of Future Past,its mindboggling premise jawdropping cast xmen days future past blasts into cinemas bearing weight great expectations surely mashup xmen past future has potential best superhero blockbuster our world will ever see well yes no,9
X-Men: Days of Future Past,strictly objective days future past can occasionally come off little too earnest its enormous cast characters getting somewhat lost grinding its narrative gears but when works which most time days future past comes pretty darn close nerdvana – smart rich film effectively mines its source material both movies chris claremonts classic 1981 storyline comic books its incredible cast emotion power depth,10
X-Men: Days of Future Past,flash forward bleakest futures xmen we have known – led perennial frenemies professor charles xavier patrick stewart erik lensherrmagneto ian mckellen – being hunted mercilessly horde intelligent deathmongering robots known sentinels little hope survival desperate xmen decide send wolverine hugh jackman back time 1970s there he must find younger charles james mcavoy erik michael fassbender – several years estranged after traumatic events xmen first class – get them change future before can happen,9
X-Men: Days of Future Past,sounds simple enough not really days future past frequently threatens fall foul its complicated puzzlebox narrative one involves time travel quantum physics swirling mess characters action motivations theres dr bolivar trask peter dinklage creator sentinel programme whose assassination past charles pseudosister raven jennifer lawrence brings about dystopia future there prison breaks astral projections several grisly mutant deaths truthfully incredibly ambitious mix character plot spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong,10
X-Men: Days of Future Past,whats so impressive about director bryan singers return franchise how well he weaves all disparate threads his narrative together emphatically not singer who gave us mediocre misfires like superman returns jack giant slayer rather work singer who made his mark films like x1 x2 usual suspects all which featured masterful blend wit wisdom character story,8
X-Men: Days of Future Past,days future past singer skilfully plays schism opened up between erik charles end first class add welcome depths emotion high stakes already play deep difficult relationship between two men has always been fulcrum series singer allows breathe grow help mcavoy fassbender not mention stewart mckellen some best actors business director makes possible believe resentment can give way forgiveness vice versa often blink eye mcavoy particular gives shudderingly good performance man called upon help others when hes lost his own way,9
X-Men: Days of Future Past,such enormous revolving cast characters singer even manages give many – though not all – them their hearts souls alas stormororo we will never know ye thrust into unlikely role mentor broken heartsore charles wolverine must find different sort strength ingenuity within himself jackman plays role beautifully anchoring two timelines charm gravitas though still something awkward fit her part lawrence too plays ravens dilemma very well she wavers between charles offer hope eriks often bloody singlemindedness,8
X-Men: Days of Future Past,but days future past doesnt just mire itself toss tumble its characters emotional journeys singer throws few crackerjack action sequences opening film heartstopping massacre very effectively underscores dire threat posed sentinels future crucially singer also finds time space within darkest shadows his story have little fun judiciously tossing quips sight gags into mix – particularly tour de force prison break sequence which preternaturally speedy pietro maximoff evan peters better known comic aficionados quicksilver literally runs away entire show,8
X-Men: Days of Future Past,make no mistake about behemoth film wont go down well everybody newbies will almost certainly find themselves lost bewildered perhaps even bored singers tale sprawls so many directions if youre not least marginally invested characters could prove trying experience,9
X-Men: Days of Future Past,but everyone else ranging casual fans enthusiasts obsessives singer screenwriter simon kinberg have crafted something truly remarkable steeped history lore both cinematic comicbook variety days future past feels like dark love letter spirit original band mutants message hope tolerance humanity has always accompanied their attempts find their place earth,10
X-Men: Days of Future Past,most remarkably all days future past practically radiates bravery freshness youd never expect seventh film blockbuster franchise instead playing safe sound days future past mashes up past present future sweeping up lot what has been taken granted xmen cinematic universe well chucking out proverbial window ending film truly opens up intriguing plethora narrative possibilities stretch any all directions strength outing thats something anticipated rather than feared,10
X-Men: Days of Future Past,seamlessly blending old new elements franchise together one delightful package xmen days future past combines emotional drama exhilarating action surprising humor create wholly satisfying experience ranks among finest franchise,10
X-Men: Days of Future Past,2014 has proved successful year so far marvel captain america winter soldier most recent xmen days future past bryan singer returns most recent xmen after being absent past four films what return he has made days future past truly impressive spectacular instalment both x men franchise entire marvel cinematic universe combining casts both original trilogy prequel allowing audience view xmen past present future action scenes intense spectacularly choreographed some fantastic heroes foes fighting both against alongside each other personal opinion days future past best film have graced marvel film franchise one greatest superhero films alltime visually stunning exhilarating flick combines best elements series create fantastic entertaining film,5
X-Men: Days of Future Past,i so intrigued about movie i had terrible feeling disappointment because first class absolutely fine riveting one even better than xmen 2 last one directed brian singer before so i tried went see low expectation what wonderful entertainment surprising thoughtful story i found here days future past best xmen movie so far two main reasons,5
X-Men: Days of Future Past,fans original trilogy first class will definitely enjoy one thanking its nostalgia its perfect well balanced mix between original characters new ones just few ones who maybe deserved more credit but not all problem movie movie delivers surprising top notch entertaining potent story some good twists help live up expectations mixed terrific special effects cinematography 3d very cool here,4
X-Men: Days of Future Past,actors fantastic fassbender mcavoy still delivering amazing performances meanwhile stewart mckellen give their reflections same excellent way trilogy hugh jackman finally finds his character true important one comparison last movies wolverinelogan finally has proper treatment movie will help anyone who could annoyed his solo adventures love him again they five main stars story inclusion spectacular skillful mystique impressive jennifer lawrence who steals almost every scene hers who undoubtedly sixth one other actors made good performances make possible transitions story until amazing finale,6
X-Men: Days of Future Past,has been so many comparisons avengers let me tell you something all my respect i found one truly better xmen days future past will please fans moviegoers will inject fresh blood joy franchise terrific time movies dont miss opportunity see,10
Onward,i hated movie because hit me so hard lost my dad while back never dealt all things but movie kinda drop kicked my feelings into focus hard watch film tears streaming down your face,9
Onward,great film about siblings incredible bond they can share i enjoyed every second dont listen haters,10
Onward,dead parent trope might overused disney movies but onward doesnt make mistakes those movies siblings fight like siblings though out not just plot critical moments their single mom has boyfriend who not evil stepparent trope their mom actually proactive during events film but adventure still belongs boys ive been tired plots have parents oblivious what their kids doing i came dnd references but i cried wellrounded characters,9
Onward,doing fulfilling movie boys where price quest emotional wholeness found love rare sight not easy task pixar succeeded providing rich brotherly relationship adventure magic finally love much more common message movies girls like frozen but i think magical combination all ingredients achieved pixar important entertaining same time wholeheartedly recommend anyone,9
Onward,its fantastic movie might fall into cliches but thats what movie all about brings sense epic viewer engage their feelings its well balanced movie emphasizes adventure aspect but without forgetting comic times well really touchy moments were youll sure moved its great movies will introduce you some aspects role playing way you probably havent thought before great both kids adults,9
Onward,movie pretty fast paced characters always trying get out some kind mess they created so other words youre never bored i recommend you watch film your siblings im grown man film had me tearing up lol another great film pixar,8
Onward,wow pixar really moving onward creativity originality while story itself plotting may suffer few issues like predictibility times amazing animation stunning visuals along beautifully designed characters great chemistry beetween actors who voiced those characters perfectly make movie great enjoyable worth watching way theyve used mixture real life elements fantasy elements dungeons dragons universe also great worth mentioning while first look doesnt feel like pixar movie more time you spend watching you will get all feelings heart you expect your average pixar movie dan scanlon did great job time,9
Onward,hits lot familiar road trip story beats but americana x magical fantasy setting unique one gorgeously animated provides good share memorable moments most notably guineveres heroism had me tears real gem film though last act featuring good ol dragonconquering mom completely unexpected incredible beautiful heartwrenching emotional climax not sweet but onthenose journal writing flashbacks but silent view afar 7510,8
Onward,ending enchanting just fact he gave up his only chance see his father give his brother wow hit hard,10
Onward,i cant believe best animated movie year not disney its not surprise because most movies disney did 2019 were sequels remakes star wars avengers endgame which wasnt good avengers infinity wars one most creative movies ive ever watched sure its cliche however its got good moral good story good character development its humor isnt just one character contrary frozen ii visually beautiful best animated movie year i really hope disney makes more movies like,10
Onward,i excited going into onward because pixar one only studios making movies today consistently deliver not all them great some their classics but i have never had bad experience watching pixar film almost all them great some them downright masterpieces,9
Onward,onward isnt masterpiece but its close being one heart story two brothers voiced excellently tom holland chris pratt their voices brought much energy characters dynamic between two them electrifying engaging,10
Onward,overall story onward nothing groundbreaking but immensely entertaining there never dull moment isnt my favourite pixar film but its definitely up there musical score heartpounding added tension all right places,8
Onward,all characters especially two brothers have very significant arc film pure joy watch onscreen ending also most emotional i have been pixar film since inferno scene end toy story 3 almost decade ago when you understand what actual message story behind roadtrip adventure they go will move you grab you heartstrings,10
Onward,pacing didnt always flow well i would have liked first act there were couple realworld elements which i had suspend too much disbelief but overall absolutely incredible film i cant wait see again,9

Onward,really beautiful emotional movie won me primarily over its absolutely fantastic very detailed animations look use colors truely magical had so much time develope so many different characters even if its just little extras i would actually watch tv series based lives those fantasy characters suburbans very creative idea actually tell very simple common story film convinced me because just touched right buttons activated them story structure relationship between two leading characters there some great voice work most noteable tom holland octavia spencer but also chris pratt meets right tone one best pixar movies came out last years one most creative magical ones more design than story very long time got me close tears end means something animated film kudos pixar they know how bring magic back t cinema,8
Onward,pixar always hits me hardi felt those emotions meeting his dad one last timeloved,5
Onward,made me cry movie also magical really good family movie please see i really like movie great cast great humor great movie,6
Onward,feral unicorns dragons minotaur all sorts other races beautiful looking city we get stuck van two hours least thats how felt larger two brothers felt like reskin buzz lightyear while younger brother everything i hate character action well if you watched preview you have pretty much already seen all action film has offer except ending which really not all satisfying you kind left feeling like you peeking through hole looking what could have been,4
Onward,movie so flat i felt forced laugh slightest bits comedy given throughout no genuinely funny moments i saw cliche dead father race against time almost get but you learn something all along along way exposition totally rushed gave no backstories reasons like these characters care them ian character your typical average teen character voice nearly got my nerves barley what name lol okay but not developed fully focused he should have been manticore just miss fritter cars 3 mother reminiscent squishys mother monsters u no real chance any character not even ian fully developed me grow connection them rushed cliche predictable ending attempt pull me almost did but just wasnt enough,8
Onward,no not even close being like frozen besides only having each other cliche despite these two having their mother but would definitely recommend over,8
Onward,onward isnt one pixars best but its still great fantasy adventure about rediscovering magic thats fun funny emotional tom holland chris pratt both incredible have perfect chemistry octavia spencer julia louisdreryfus both great usual animation incredible consistently stunning music mychael danna really good dan scanlons direction great,4
Onward,quest clear path never right one,3
Raiders of the Lost Ark,movie has all action romance comedy giant boulders occult seeking nazis story conceived george lucas screenplay written same guy wrote empire strikes back return jedi if doesnt sell then look no further than steven spielberg because he directed awesome movie all around definitely genre classic absolute must see any movie fan likes fun,10
Raiders of the Lost Ark,nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can too much cgi makes everything possible therefore very often also arbitrary raiders you actually seem feel physical pain some actorsstuntmen had go through provide 2 hours pure entertainment,10
Raiders of the Lost Ark,course story isnt waterproof nazi werent present egypt 1936 how did indy survive ride submarine again but lots good variable action scenes accompanied story develops fast excitingly always close being implausible but luckily never,10
Raiders of the Lost Ark,spielberg lucas most all harrison ford created hero nowadays iconic their attempt make homage adventure comics 1930s they created their own legend,10
Raiders of the Lost Ark,its funny exiting thrilling romantic what more can you ask,10
Raiders of the Lost Ark,hot sunny day south america we see bunch men shot mostly back they walking deep into forest we see tall dark figure he wearing old leather jacket he has 5 oclock shadow looking like its closer midnight he wears fedora he carries bullwhip yes bullwhip finally two men enter cave we hear about some guy named forstall who good very very good but he never came out place alive but they enter anyway they confronted tarantulas spears triggered blocking out light pit they must swing over then more tiny poisonous darts come out wall all protect ancient gold statue they recover one guy dies other barely makes out room before all falls him then he has get out cave giant boulder chases him finally he makes out cave only surrounded hovitos his arch enemy named belloq he takes gold statue guy worked so hard then guy runs makes plane where he passenger seat there big snake plane he hates snakes mans name indiana jones,10
Raiders of the Lost Ark,whhhoooooo im left breathless just describing opening but there better beginning movie ever absolutely not does beginning have anything do rest film no all decoration what movie going put you through 90 minutes come,9
Raiders of the Lost Ark,indiana jones best character ever hit screens he better he created george steven played harrison ford may seem normal now we have lived him 20 years but can you imagine what must have been like back 1981 would like tom hanks will smith joining forces james cameron steven spielberg completely original idea todays terms,9
Raiders of the Lost Ark,raiders took simple idea maybe idea guys had watching saturday afternoon movies made larger than life film never stops you take your breath filled rich characters indy himself marion belloq even marcus brody each has their own personality shines through certain scenes some my faves were when we first meet marion having shot contest her bar nepal then there her scene belloq they get drunk together she tries leave using only butter knife course who can forget indys battle swordsman his unrivaled determination get ark indy there not time if you still want truck being loaded truck cairo battered bloody indy truck what truck then later get some transport back england boat plane anything meet me omars im going after truck,10
Raiders of the Lost Ark,sola how indy i dont know im making up i go,10
Raiders of the Lost Ark,raiders has more energy than three action films what makes classic if you like movies then raiders movie will not let you down pure entertainment indisputable finds youngster all us bombards us silly whipcracking average incredibly determined archaeologist only asks us have fun we do me only reason chariots fire won best picture year because serious film raiders heads shoulders above chariots should have cleaned up oscars 81 but more politics academy,9

Raiders of the Lost Ark,i think part down fact its complete retake old serial movies combined obvious comic book style just perfect kids appeals them no end rather did then so excitement i opened my presents my birthday found boxset indiana jones trilogy even more excitement when i finally watched first trilogy raiders lost ark,7
Raiders of the Lost Ark,just i remembered fun excitement wise cracks tiny splattering romance but manliness kids would allow lots stunts action its superb movie captures style serials adventure stories comic books perfectly how i know sure only through repeats since i wasnt alive during those times,10
Raiders of the Lost Ark,set pieces fantastic although some wilder end sequences slightly dated now hasnt lost excitement factor its perfectly crafted movie well moving location location without any distraction superfluous scenes just feels like its all there reason belongs there,7
Raiders of the Lost Ark,harrison ford excellent role im inclined think he more indy than he solo but thats personal opinion he has many more facial movements voice inclinations early movie than he does nowadays now he belongs moody quiet school acting then he dynamic adventurous strong wisecracking best them,3
Raiders of the Lost Ark,there some excellent movie making moments george lucas steven spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out every pore where did all go star wars i iii mr lucas they end up making excellently entertaining movie,4
Raiders of the Lost Ark,some could argue there could bit more depth seriousness story but come its ripping adventure yarn you dont need depth saving ark nazis surely thats enough excellent movie great fun too without doubt one my favourite all time,6
Raiders of the Lost Ark,if youve seen movie heard score then my one line summary wont read like mating call sheep but rather absolutely exhilarating raiders march which stirs my blood makes me think unforgettable hero indiana jones if not see now,7
Raiders of the Lost Ark,i love going movies i always have i remember when film came out my friends had seen before i had they boasted great best film ever some even said better than star wars utter blasphemy devout 10 year old jediwannabe i thought no way film better than star wars but i still curious began begging my father take me,5
Raiders of the Lost Ark,when i young almost all films i had seen i saw my dad he would take me my mother would stay home my siblings we saw number films failed generate reaction him they did me but one different one my dad mightve enjoyed just much,10
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,what can i say far most amazing finale any fan could have asked i cried i laughed i short breath many instances i disturbed but overall i thoroughly satisfied conclusion series i felt something amazing after movie ended something i didnt feel after reading book being able watch end harry potter big screen really brought impact just how much series has touched not only my life but lives everyone around me deathly hallows part 2 far my opinion best movie 2011 quite possibly one best movies all time i dont want give any spoilers i just want express how happy i am film picks up where part 1 left off all characters get closure they deserve story just comes full circle,10

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,conclusion series hits some strongest emotional beats mainly due our longstanding connection characters provides some grand visual treats form extended magical battles while harry potter deathly hallows part 2 2011 may biggest scale entertaining does feel lacking depth since some things left oddly unexplained instead comes across extended third act its duration actually plays out like one long climax little buildup required further invest audience but least its well paced doesnt hang about strong note which end phenomenal series 810,10
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,i am huge fan harry potter books theyre all so great magical but i didnt think film series were perfect all but they were still great movies i extremely excited see end film franchise impressed trailers so i had high expectations thankfully did not disappoint harry potter deathly hallows part ii blew past my already high expectations i enthralled,7
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,whole movie looked spectacular cinematography extremely well done art direction incredible movie beautiful look visuals were spectacular truly oscar worthy set designers cinematographers really need awarded their work because looks like they spend time money look film,10
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,cast film pretty much perfect they should all applauded too emma watson usual great shell have bright career ahead her rupert grint pretty much great also he fine actor indeed daniel radcliffe did amazing job very memorable harry potter although i think ralph fiennes star film he did unbelievable job evil crazy lord voldemort i think he deserves oscar nomination his role rest cast were also great too,6
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,we all grew up overtime series we followed adventures harry potter around 10 years i think seems very weird there will no more harry potter films look forward too i will miss franchise very much however i am happy series got amazing ending harry potter deathly hallows part ii not only best film series but will probably one best films 2011 everyone should see film even if they dont like past harry potter films,9
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,i saw preview screening london,6
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,deathly hallows part 2 ends incredibly well produced saga tremendous grace beautifully orchestrated climax i am sure will satisfy both lovers books films,10
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,if you have read books i have you will glad know major key moments intact much missing but i wont dwell no point its how well movie plays out me rolls wonderfully between excitement thrills emotional drama towards satisfactory though slightly rushed conclusion,8
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,there least 2 sequences so powerful i defy anyone not least stifle tear choke little one those sequence exquisitely executed flashback pivotal whole story,10
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,i have say despite woes we book readers have when elements big chunks too omitted movies much credit still has go steve kloves adapting books big screen cleverly weaving changing even adding new big elements give kinetic flow narrative here all comes together superbly,10
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,david yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors last 4 films blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters natural tones without overacting daniel radcliffe had carry movie more than any other has done so brilliantly complemented great support his two companions emma watson rupert grint,3
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,pretty much all characters we have met all movies have made appearance finale but one actor stands out alan rickman his portrayal professor snape has always been joy watch if little novel but here his scenes will leave dramatic engraving my memory here he elevates his portrayal one most complex character young adult literature unforgettable piercingly emotional one,2
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,another actor who really shines few scenes he has matthew lewis neville longbottom who we see gradually transforming over past films clumsy bullied boy brave warrior final film many other british thespians series also have their few moments shine especially maggie smiths professor mcgonagal who delight watch she takes charge defence hogwarth school,5
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,spectacle battle showdowns while not scale lord rings i honestly cant think how could have been done better film makers have intertwined heart stopping action dramatic progressions narrative its actually more visceral dynamic than rather smaller scale battle brilliant novels not take anything away rowlings writing,9
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,do i have any gripes yes i do although i applaud steve kloves difficult screenplay adaptioni think he could still have done better explaining some odd anomalies only readers book will understand might annoy you if you havent read books but its small gripe because what we get delightful,9
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,what amazing achievement faithfully bring rowlings epic saga big screen same cast largely same crew maintaining brilliant quality right end,9
Catch Me If You Can,opening credits design we get mood very entertaining film they create tone what will follow steven spielberg rare form directing movie doesnt have dull moment,10
Catch Me If You Can,mr spielberg has found perfect actor fill shoes con man perfect casting leonardo dicaprio its very easy see why all women fall prey charmer he fast talker slick operator he exudes charisma fill another couple movies,7
Catch Me If You Can,its welcome sight have mr dicaprio working vehicle shows his talent frank abagnale man many faces he plays game hideandseek throughout movie hanratty fbi agent his trail tom hanks shows great assurance gusto character course dicaprio magnetism dominates action many ironic twists miraculous narrow escapes he pulls aplomb thats bewildering feds who his tail all time,9
Catch Me If You Can,minor roles equally important christopher walken father starts out prototype con man but hes too decent do wrong his business fails eventually his marriage natalie baye fine french actress ends divorce because obviously she hates being married loser,8
Catch Me If You Can,action doesnt stop one moment film great fun watch winning combination mr spielberg assured hand gives us time out mr spielberg can thank genial mr dicaprio who responds obviously his direction makes con man endearing even when he committing crimes,8
Catch Me If You Can,first i thought i going see lightweight film great director but instead i watched another impressive achievement steven spielberg few things stand out course performances terrific leonardo dicaprio believable guy can convince people hes someone else dicaprio charmer very smooth we watch his character do some fancy talk young ladies tom hanks fbi agent reminds me his cynical character he played league their own his mere presence adds more film sign great film star christopher walken gives one his best performances his already interesting career last scene him he talks his son restaurant so moving reflects great talent walken you can understand why dicaprio admires loves his father walken conveys these emotions makes audience react just accurately ill rooting him oscar time another impressive thing about film beautiful cinematography janusz kaminski whos real artist camera has worked several spielberg films one shot particular stands out ray sunshine coming through kitchen window walken very thought provoking course since its spielberg film its very personal spielberg interested frank abagnale character because youngster he also came broken family wanted someone else spielberg would sneak onto studios tell people he worked there also real frank abagnale jr appears french police officer well made extremely well acted sharply written viewers seem forget really film about breaking up family aftermath really personal film spielberg very good one,10
Catch Me If You Can,while watching catch me if you can i had so much fun i smiled constantly well smile interrupted laughs movie tells story frank w abignale jr who just kid he pretends schoolteacher after his father mother get divorce he runs away starts pretending copilot doctor lawyer way he does funny brilliant,8
Catch Me If You Can,i am not big fan leonardo dicaprio who plays frank but movie he perfect he gives very fine performance tom hanks fbiagent carl who after him always hanks good,8
Catch Me If You Can,story inspired real story i dont know how many ways true but watching guy all i wanted see him pulling more his nice little tricks scene where he pretends schoolteacher just great if you want nice funny movie not too heavy one will definitely please you,10
Catch Me If You Can,what terrific piece filmmaking charming animated title sequence featuring john williamss delightfully sneaky score end enormously entertaining film gifted craftsman steven spielberg who so damn good people take him granted resent his manipulation ie his seemingly effortless ability create effective drama,10
Catch Me If You Can,leonardo dicaprio his best performance ive seen stars frank abagnale jr reallife teenaged con man so spectacularly gifted he able steal millions various companies forged checks while successfully impersonating airline pilot doctor lawyer among other guises he chased rigidly rulebound fbi agent carl hanratty tom hanks who first comically outclassed young improvising criminal genius but agent steadfast relentless has law his side movie filled delightful supporting performances starting hanks continuing nathalie baye boys selfish mother amy adams his immature fiancée down tiniest role im especially grateful sympathetic part given christopher walken mischievous spirited abagnale sr whose life darkens his fortunes fall walken one my favorite actors but while i enjoy occasional onedimensional freak villain he plays i wish most his parts were like,10
Catch Me If You Can,spielbergs movie rich fascinating details memorable incidents while script jeff nathanson moves backward forward time tell story most engrossing way possible topnotch entertainment,8
Catch Me If You Can,entertaining fun piece film making everreliable steven spielberg bit depart his usual fullblown hugely epic pictures yet does not detract all fascinating story frank abagnale jr i interested man before id seen movie only served increase my interest although important remember any such film only inspired true story not told word word one plot fascinating keeps you laughing crying wondering until end,9
Catch Me If You Can,frank abagnale jr astounding interesting character real life abagnale originally said he did not believe dicaprio suave enough play role but he certainly does pull off dicaprios acting superb totally believable man who could lie deceive con everyone he met without once losing any his charisma charm hanks also excellent he plays role obsessed fbi agent well also likable quality interaction between these two characters great interesting see budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another,7
Catch Me If You Can,i loved look film refreshing blast see 60s portrayed such vivid colorful way whole setting atmosphere film gave wonderful almost i hesitate use word magical sense tone appealed me much more than darker tone might have,8
Catch Me If You Can,however film rife moral ambiguity much fun watch dicaprio jumping one place identity next forging checks spending inordinate amounts money whim film never really focuses morally bankrupt side story portion film devoted end still seems skim over fact man has stolen millions dollars ends high note frank abagnale jr never fully spelling out wrongs he committed still would probably bring whole film down sometimes its fun just enjoy bit escapism without being told off desiring such things i mean its hard totally strict upright you have love when dicaprios character swindles jennifer garners prostitute 400,10
Catch Me If You Can,overall fun film really enjoyable not much epic masterpiece some spielbergs other movies but still great film,10
Catch Me If You Can,leonardo dicaprios 31st birthday i have pleasure praising one finest actors working today i didnt realize what i seeing when homeless boy showed up growing painsa show not exactly known quality its actors i didnt see much like about titanic except excitement watching people evacuating ship sinking also romeo juliet just corny 400yearold dialogue modern setting,9
Catch Me If You Can,but if he could nominated his aviator performance dicaprio must doing something right here he shows us what he capable especially when frank jr conning people most all when he tries outwit hanatty i am reminded harrison ford tommy lee jones fugitive perhaps burt reynolds jackie gleason smokey bandit strange but enjoyable chemistry between these two characters goes long way toward making movie work,6
The Town,despite not having seen gone baby gone ive heard lot good things about ben afflecks switch directing so i decided watch town which put simply about band robbers but expand film also about leader group played ben affleck,8
The Town,when watching trailer easy draw comparisons heat departed but different many films about crime make audience side either police criminals yet town allows audience see people both sides law fairly jon hamm plays honest working fbi officer while ben affleck plays criminal film shot predominately criminals perspective therefore audience feel same sense urgency they do but we dont want see them gun down fbi police let them get away their crimes difficult challenge director deal but he does well end result very good,8
The Town,entire cast all fantastic even when given smaller roles example chris cooper late pete postlethwaite steel scenes they jeremy renner has earned lot attention his role he deserves giving honest performance which clearly took lot research perfect almost unrecognisable blake lively rebecca hall both great ben affleck jon hamm opposing forces also great but renners performance stands out,8
The Town,crime film important action doesnt turn whole film into all guns blazing film action scenes handed pretty well car chases through minor roads boston really exciting watch,8
The Town,town not only only solid action crime film but also marks affleck great director i strongly recommend film if you interested genre while not perfect does so much well you would missing out if you didnt see,9
The Town,say town everything takers tried failed would actually insult ben afflecks latest film mentioning bland rehashing same breath would imply they even exist same plane but honest truth gritty boston crime drama something special best film early fall season,8
The Town,afflecks first foray into directing dennis lehane adaptation gone baby gone shocked viewers critical community kind showing fading acting career does not mean one downandout hollywood affleck marries his two passions town directing producing writing film well starring lead role his first since 2003s paycheck he owns comeback performance successfully wiping any lingering distaste duds like daredevil gigli no means oneman show but town has nothing close weak link fact may one finest pieces ensemble acting years,9
The Town,joining affleck supporting role jeremy renner fresh off his best actor oscar nomination hurt locker he beyond doubt proves he no onehit wonder oscarworthy acting yet again renner nailing his boston accent along his loosecannon mentality he terrifying but impossible pry your eyes away most shocking revelation comes blake lively tvs gossip girl dopedup mother more than few issues she not only unrecognizable but owns her role never calling attention her drastic deviation type substantial buzz also placed way john hamm acclaimed television drama mad men he sufficiently pompous dedicated fbi agent also scoring number films laughs,6
The Town,before i wander too much further into specifics characters town populate boston suburb called charlestown which introductory message informs us worldcenter bank robbers afflecks doug macray heads team those such profession including renner james coughlin two others played slaine owen burke during one their routine bank heists they forced take hostage rebecca hall during their hasty escape afterwards make sure she does not know anything incriminating following her release captivity macray follows her inadvertently falls her process,10
The Town,there nothing particularly revelatory about town there few surprises much deviates standard crime drama but affleck directs such skill confidence while showcasing yet another peek into suburban boston never less than riveting there overlying sense impeding dread perforates town handful sensational action sequences do little let up firm grasp film has our windpipes propelled faultless acting pitch perfect script slice boston criminal underworld everything which we could have hoped following such bland summer affleck has always been star if he continues produce films pedigree then there might hope movies yet,8
The Town,my oh my how ben affleck has had up down career starting out cheesy yet funny guy those kevin smith flicks academy award winning writer good will hunting all way back down pathetic string acting he produced only 10 years ago but there silver liningwith his directorial debut gone baby gone his much improved acting hollywoodland ben affleck beginning once again prove his worth tinsel town hopefully he can continue feverish pace,8
The Town,well i can say complete just best heist movie since swordfishnow i know most you may not like swordfish but what other bank robbery movie can you compare past 10 years maybe snatch lock stockeh if you classify those movies heist pictures than okay its best heist movie since snatch maybe even oceans 11either way its big compliment,8
The Town,ben affleck has certainly proved gone baby gone not fluke he can actually direct major motion picture not only can he do he does very well sure movie had some minor flaws but nothing takes too much away overall big picture best way i can compare isits like east coast heat now group not fool proof professional gang heatwell lets face you will probably never top group movieever but never less style film making really pulls you into each sequence whether action packed bank robbery emotional dialog between characters intense decisions players all must endure,5
The Town,movie doesnt try wow you offering different style bank robbery which good thing because you really run risk tripping over your own two feet process but i really think major factor film acting everyone came play ball onebut i can also say complete confidenceben affleck best actor movie yes i know its hard swallow some you but he really showed us all what he truly capable doing so mr affleck let me tip my hat you say job well done sir you took lot crap face you wiped off came back strong,2
The Town,bottom lineyes i can honestly say one best movies year so far sure movie gets little sappy end but its pretty necessary but overall your very well entertained,8
The Town,i read article few months ago about even after gone baby gone people still wouldnt hire affleck director he had fight tooth nail land deal well hopefully now you can find more work buddy because you have certainly earned,1
The Town,ben afflecks second feature film director if nothing else proves hes no fluke all ways his sincere revealing debut gone baby gone succeeds so does town both bostonbased crime dramas both touchingly dramatic times yet gripping others more impressive his work town however proves he could just easily go direct action blockbuster he could oscarwinning drama,10
The Town,starts cast performances he gets them 2007 he helped amy ryan supporting actress nomination thats ignoring other talents film such casey affleck michelle monaghan ed harris town he gets oscar nominee jeremy renner his first major film since his breakout hurt locker jon hamm his first major film since tvs mad men took off he also gets pair upandcomers rebecca hall gossip girl star blake lively thats not mention pete postelthwaite chris cooper next inception its best ensemble cast year,5
The Town,based chuck hogan novel prince thieves film follows team bank robbers charlestown area notorious grooming best intercepting armored cars taking down banks gone baby gone also based novel dennis lehane city boston people culture important affleck plot hes sure let shots charlestown bridge fenway park soak amidst everbuilding pinch main characters,9
The Town,doug macray affleck his buddy jim renner couple others pull off bank job opening scene but when doesnt go exactly planned theyre forced kidnap bank manager hall make sure she didnt see anything can hand them platter feds led jon hamms special agent frawley doug trails her only find himself falling her,1
The Town,town one those crime dramasbankjob action films while not revelatory genre executes everything well sticks characterdriven story order stay meaningful perhaps reason works so well because floats between drama never becoming too much guns n robbers flick but also not slipping into crime melodrama too long afflecks performance macray acts accordance its tastefully understated he lets go machismo has marred few his previous roles,5
The Town,film also has unexpected but much appreciated sense humor mileaminute crime dramathriller you dont expect laugh way you will town which speaks even more writing afflecks versatility even if there some plot conventions nosurprise characters good hamm hes playing every other quickwitted fbi guy films dialogue sharp story exciting way we so easily able see things macrays perspective bank robber who wants out makes up any use convention crutch,9
The Town,theres no doubt if town becomes success studios will seek out affleck some more highprofile projects will certainly interesting see how he handles material not rooted boston subculture long he continues get such memorable performances out his actors hell doing things other end camera long time come,10
The Town,steven c,5

Red Sparrow,shows how close truth film not documentary however lots fun has lot action violence sex russian fbi arrested had moved conservative leader main actor actress give their all put ina fine performance,9
Red Sparrow,yet nothing brutal films beginning where hopes literally shattered,8

Red Sparrow,ps jennifer lawrence one hell actor,8
The Notebook,all honesty my dad paid me go see notebook my friends because he kept saying how magnificent i went because free no expectations however notebook drew me into story beginning right up until credits then kept me crying quite some time after had ended i along almost every other person i have discussed movie felt involved situations lives character crying sad moments feeling joy happy bits general love stories predictable somewhat dull my opinion yet movie kept me guessing outcome delivered twists throughout whole filmthe notebook extremely well constructed i would give eleven out ten,10
The Notebook,i went see film my sister my mum we were only ones cinema not best start but i continued watch anyway am so glad i did probably one most beautiful romantic films i have ever seen relationship two characters their surroundings every scene breathtaking notebook tells story summer romance turns into romance never forgotten allie noah two lead characters they wonderful you immediately fall love characters you want follow every step their doomed love story one greatest love stories ever told look out lake scene unbelievable i came out cinema wanting go back again watch all over again feels like you reading diary watching film thats how detailed wonderful film cannot really give too much away about story all i can say if you havent seen film yet sure see i cannot think film more perfect valentines day,10
The Notebook,movie seems postcard perfect lesson straight out directors guide romantic movies boy meets girl carnival love other side tracks date water etc yet wonderful thing about movie takes what seems like story youve heard already least bits pieces still moves you deeply really speaks about love way most romantic movies miss speaking cliché over shoot adding numerous complications dramatize things there have been other great movies comment love recent years eternal sunshine lost translation jump mind but movie fills need those other movies miss need straight sweep you off your feet romance too bad there cant movies like every year,10
The Notebook,often times when movie comes source material such novel did well people who were fans book end up not liking movie much sometimes those same fans even end up hating movie not even giving chance seeing such case i already knew ending nicholas sparkss novel even before i got into theater let me clear up though best thing about film i ended up getting wrapped story screen rather than sitting there thinking myself what part story should coming next what makes great adaptation when you can get lost story forget about your thoughts what going outside world not only but film soared past any expectations i had start too being very well directed acted,10
The Notebook,best known his acting credits nick cassavetes tapped direct film his past experience which didnt consist very many films includes denzel washington film john q not going easy task him though because story built us believing love main characters film would showing real its not easy sounds some films like star wars part 2 end up making audience laugh rather than feel what characters feeling he did great job helped put together great cast film would end up including ryan gosling rachel mcadams james garner joan allen all actors who have found their niches before were brought film help carry story,10
The Notebook,gosling best known his role richie one kids murder numbers he brings great innocence role noah calhoun film one two main characters rachel mcadams plays other half duo allie hamilton she actually one leads regina george earlier summer movie mean girls heart film couple represents love story being told james garners character he reads book story two lovers they go through everything life has offer gena rowlands plays lady he reading she gets wrapped up story we do he progresses chapter chapter novel he reading garner perfect role shows his narrating skills he explains how two them live,10
The Notebook,meanwhile story noah allie meet one cutest scenes movie he sees her carnival knows right away he wants her he does not know quite why first all he can say something inside him drawing him her he convinces her give him chance she eventually agrees give him date he seeks what progresses there summer romance goes through all emotions we all have experienced before what makes even more real not played off if every single moment perfect between two them depicts they do have fights they do have disagreements but they do have love stronger than any what made romance real me everyone knows real life we cant have relationship where everything works out perfectly where everyone agrees everything,10
The Notebook,romance blossoms but problem exists could spell trouble noah one parent family sees himself working lumberyard better part his life he says he has found his place life what cards have planned him allie other hand come very welloff family being brought up rich societal circle her family spending her 17th summer small town sea first comes across noah pure coincidence romance between them kept under wraps quite while until her parents find out mother immediately thinks should end but father feels just summer thing will come end rather quickly until she out late one night noah he takes side his wife they see no future between their daughter boy take her away him first chance they get,10
The Notebook,coupled outbreak world war ii keeps them apart couple years story really gets underway will their love able endure separation will one them move something easier their own lives story becomes epic its own its starts split time between story being read story garner rowlands living present day what i love about films like these we given opportunity enjoy two different stories going same time love shown noah allie something envelopes us makes us forget about current story going back forth we able look forward where each two stories going all leads ending each story both very enjoyable very emotional same time,10
The Notebook,i said before sometimes book can fail transition film not one those cases movie instead becomes its own entity both stories have great chemistry between characters center them amazing just how well actorsactresses parts play their roles just how much we audience start care about their lives progresses we truly care about what will happen main characters we have our own minds how we want things turn out type film where we start become part story want them act say something specific truly makes great story even though movie heavily geared lovers romance novels film i found very enjoyable i highly recommend seeing film while theaters purchasing when hits dvd because has everything needed truly great love story,10
The Notebook,amazing love story can enjoyed all notebook not one those cheesy chick flicks often come out brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers most people can relate,9
The Notebook,even most males will agree movie pulls your heart strings filled fabulous quotes sentimental moments i found movie one best ive seen i got know both main characters found myself relating each them most us remember our first love strong connection we had them movie makes us think what could have been gives us fresh look meaning true love i recommend movie anyone heart,8
The Notebook,i went into movie misconception thinking just another typical romantic movie but i very impressed film themes portrayed movie were handled great way,10
The Notebook,movie will have you feeling happy joyful scenery just brilliant you will feel like you part characters you will care about them throughout whole movie,1
The Notebook,movie gallops speed we absorbed into great plot brilliant acting all cast involved ryan gosling brilliant shy quiet noah rachael mcadams superbly beautiful star movie allie,1
The Notebook,i said earlier my review i did go into movie not expecting much because i thought typical boy loves girl movie which sometimes just too predictable dont get me wrong they some good romantic movies pull off very well but there simply too many particular genre,1
The Notebook,best thing about movie depth plot actors playing their characters so well supporting cast were good james marsden deserves mention managing pull hard role rich man well another plus point about movie great script you did not see too many cliches which always good sign romance movie,1
The Notebook,does not matter whether you love romantic movies hate them not just romantic movie so more than end movie you will feel whole heap emotions you will talking about movie long time,2
The Notebook,only bad part about movie length which i think could shortened bit but whole superb movie which well worth watch,1
The Notebook,go watch amazing movie which will have you brimming joy,1
The Notebook,9 12 out 10,9
I See You,if you want movie offers some good suspense one does pretty good job misdirection along some wtf head scratching moments then you cant go wrong film,8
I See You,very well directed eerie feel i often wonder why more thrillers like dont utilize power sound musical scores build tension scene anyways i pleasantly surprised year hasnt released many good movies i hope see more director,8
I See You,very well executed mystery thriller keeps you edge entire time well done bravo thank you,10
I See You,10aug,8
I See You,plot jackie harper trying fix her marriage after her affair her high school sweetheart but her husband son not making easy make things worse there creepy presence house,7
I See You,poster seemed cool i thought would cool horror film actually mysterythriller film not horror film,8
I See You,there three phases film first phase revolves around harper family little strange occurrences happens around house film progresses those strange events become increasingly creepy there also drama centering unfaithfulness wife first phase takes almost 60 percent run time i loved phase i had no idea what going lots questions were running around my head then comes second phase which takes totally different turn terms cinematography tone film some hand held shots were used which distracted me ambience created first phase weakest phase film thank god shortest phase well,8
I See You,last phase shows lots details tries tie story lines i liked most part phase well tone film shifts here well,9
I See You,acting good all actors music nice well frog mask creepy there were some solid twists which surprised me,7
I See You,film has distinct phases goes mystery thriller action overall experience diminishes little production value low sometimes feels like low budget tvmovie there some inconsistencies story,9
I See You,i enjoyed film clever film some genuine surprises story i liked creepy ambience film also little dramas between characters short run time also works favor film,10
I See You,dont believe genre tag straight up thrillermistery there absolutely no horror all you will totally completely dissapointed if youre horror,8
I See You,said if you enjoy thrillers i see you completely delivers there handful surprises will make you want see least twice i didnt really saw twice but i definitely rewinded some parts,10
I See You,has smart script keeps you guessing while behaviors characters sometimes made my eyes roll most explained later there only two three things they had force you have turn blind eye order fully enjoy,8
I See You,i see you will stay you little while wont give you all answers im still wondering why he chose song what happened trailer leaves imagination mine went really dark places making movie extremely dark,10
I See You,opening scene i see you interesting one implies supernatural element film consequently made me lose interest little while hindsight its really clever well executed scene i can appreciate thats thing about movie everything about hindsight i love i love movie presents something seemingly bizarre then explains itself problem audience has patient through first half film requires trust modern world terrible films can tough thing give film however if you do use patience i see you you will have great time,9
I See You,hard tell early just how dark film going i knew had r rating so there had more going than initially met eye film tends get darker darker goes along reveals itself theres concept used film i cant reveal because would spoiler however starting used more more films its really creepy idea because could happen anyone could even happening you right now without you knowing i see you puts its own twist does little differently which i liked but its just another element film works extremely well,8
I See You,i love when horror movies gets things right i see you well crafted little film well worth your time almost demands second viewing afterwards fully appreciate one not missed,10
I See You,fantastic i almost didnt watch because negative reviews so glad i did keeps you edge your seat whole way through,7
I See You,i love good mystery problem i have most though ive seen so many i tend figure them out before final moments film so when one comes along catches me completely off guard becomes one i want people know about i see you one those films,6
I See You,movie actually divided into two parts second half reflecting first its fall small town people frightened their children when young teen goes missing det greg harper jon tenney lead detective case case few clues but thats not only issue harper dealing,8
I See You,there problems home well harpers wife jackie helen hunt cheating him theyre trying make things work his son connor judah lewis resentful his mothers indiscretion holds her responsible falling apart their family every effort she makes try correct things he tosses back her face,8
I See You,have you seen posters placed around town search boy continues when harper his partner spitzky gregory alan williams go back over crime scene they discover something they missed first time around its green pocket knife references previous crime they worked years ago could same killer have returned,9
I See You,case moves forward strange things begin happening harper home entire drawer silverware disappears noises heard windows found open then worst all happens when jackies lover shows up trying convince her run away him leaving him garage when she goes answer door someone kills him there something supernatural involved here could something else time spoiler alert if you dont want know,10

Apocalypse Now,apocalypse now not only best war film ever made but its also one best films all time won prestigious palme dor cannes its constantly recognized benchmark cinematic history based novel hearts darkness joseph conrad film not so much about vietnam war about war general serves deep study into dark places human soul how war can affect individual apocalypse now depicts timeless story about universal human struggle duality man consisting morality savage primordial instinct what every person chooses base his actions upon,10
Apocalypse Now,film has simple premise us army captain benjamin willard martin sheen ordered dangerous mission into cambodia through river assassinate renegade colonel kurtz marlon brando who has gone insane set himself up god among local native tribe its accessible premise allowing film consumed even most casual movie watchers yet film anything but shallow its journey into madness hysteria observation into darkness humanity i could write book analyzing film theres just so much talk about my interpretation river not only passage find kurtz but also descent into madness reflection characters inner journey towards evil accomplished through main theme movie dehumanization journey through river also reminiscent dantes perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings horrors there three major stops before kurtz each stop river furthers dehumanization war has brought well implanting new type evil characters,10
Apocalypse Now,first stop lieutenant kilgore stop shows kilgore his soldiers have been consumed love war after they dehumanized enemy their love war has blinded them so much they see no negative cant comprehend consequences war will bring one scene movie heroic marching helicopters lay wrath upon their enemies captain kilgore uses wagners ride valkyries pump his soldiers scare his enemies like mythical creatures valkyries he decider who lives who dies battle stage although everyone has removed any shred humanity enemy they still understand innocent,10
Apocalypse Now,second stop uso show where we see loss morality well dehumanization innocent stop we see soldier dehumanized everyone aside himself becoming very selfish losing any compassion anyone but themselves soldiers have passed through stop would willing put anyone risk their instant gratification now characters go deeper into river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves explore their own evils which becoming more apparent last stop before kurtz dolong bridge its point soldier has gone too far hes experienced so much trauma so much evil he lost grip his own sanity thus he dehumanized himself cant return normal state mind,10
Apocalypse Now,final stop journey kurtz point only willard kurtz have passed madness stage they competing heart darkness ultimate evil we all have capacity have kurtz possession heart darkness he associates evil strength bypassing madness stage hes able see world what truly filled hypocrites he decides bury his hatred simply act instinct willard end film rises river reborn new man ready obtain heart himself he kills kurtz leaves compound his heart corrupted end willard has choice succumb evil stay compound having taken kurtzs place leader savages abandoning them into their fatesthrowing his weapon he emerges bottomless pit he had fallen through heart darkness saving lance choosing not exterminate tribe he has completed his personal journey tested his soul very limit both them any point could have just stopped but they didnt they wanted explore depths their souls just how much further they could go,10
Apocalypse Now,film presents study human psyche through carmine coppolas eerie score hypnotic images some haunting scenes essentially taking viewer into depths hell its here where coppola succeeds most his ability create living hell so amazing perfectly captures mindset soldiers provides commentary war religion making subtext even vaster film weirdly beautiful true picture evil hell within ourselves,10
Apocalypse Now,cinematography vittorio storaro phenomenal provides hallucinatory feeling throughout films runtime faces losing minds covered endless sweat sight figures within shadows dark trenched riverbank everything captured stunning manner conveying hellish imagery still taking viewers breath away coppolas direction transcends itself camerawork its absolute best when comes use lighting shadows most notable during col kurtzs first appearance troubled production obviously didnt hurt film all most likely increased dark quality portrays apocalypse now beautifully haunting utterly hellish terrifyingly intelligent magnificently wrought slowly pushes you into horror absurdity war but also its meaningfulness beauty not only one best films ever made its psychoanalytical journey into places none us would dare venture our own francis ford coppolas magnum opus he sacrificed everything make work rightfully deserving its place one greatest cinematic pantheon immortal its contribution cinema truly unforgettable experience apocalypse now cinema its most complete crystalline pure,5
Apocalypse Now,my favourite movie all time flawed piece work coppola seeing documentary heart darkness made even more compelling coppola point king hollywood after making godfather godfatherii had developed ego necessary even dare try make movie like apocalypse now through sheer arrogance he went phillipines partial script thought he would know what he would do when he got there just captain willard thought he would know what do once he got col kurtzs compound just like willard he didnt know what he going do once he got there such masterpiece american cinema beautifully photographed river such perfect metaphor backdrop story what i like most about apocalypse now offers no answers conclusions consequently because openendedness infuriates some viewers who like their movies much more obvious,10
Apocalypse Now,movie defies categorization some call war movie which isnt all really more personal study man best pic about vietnam platoon my opinion if viewer seeking retelling vietnam war go there first answers,10
Apocalypse Now,coppola should commended his take bureaucracy war which he conveys quite effectively meeting gencorman lucas harrison ford playmate review sheer audacity kilgore makes him unforgettable character dawn attack will always hollywood classic,10
Apocalypse Now,almost psychedelic cruise very surreal ending which makes movie not accessible everyone very challenging watch but rewarding well i could offer my explanations each scene but would totally pointless movie intended interpretation contemplation opposed immediate gratification,9
Apocalypse Now,little footnote definitely if your firsttime viewer apocalypse now watch original version first redux version i think more intended hardcore fan more curiosity than new improved version movie,8
Apocalypse Now,francis ford coppolas apocalypse now not vietnam war film do not confuse one set back drop war but metaphorical exposition deteriorating effects war has human psyche also one most audacious films ever made produced even conceived second lord rings trilogy call masterpiece would understatement proportions ambitious films production levels,10
Apocalypse Now,opening no credits following memorable first scene playing tune doors end martin sheens captain benjamin l willard hallucinates images helicopters napalm plot essentially laid out first 15 minutes willards mission terminate extreme prejudice colonel kurtz marlon brando who has invariably gone awol far reaches cambodian jungle told his general out there operating without any decent restraint totally beyond pale any acceptable human conduct he still field commanding troops kurtz delusional colonel now being worshipped large group followers who have dubbed him god willard covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat yet journey he about take will personal quest will challenge limits his human behavior,10
Apocalypse Now,teaming up small crew they embark down vast reaches river rickety boat along way willard educates himself all things kurtz during sheens raspy voice over he details his thoughts abundance material he reads kurtz highly decorated respected green beret he normal man family until part him succumbed horrors human brutality he led himself down path willard being led descent into jungle marked mesmerizing aura echoes battles being fought not far away eventually power experience weights group drugs sort solitary confinement attacks their senses but willard seems unfazed desensitized his quest find kurtz he reads about mythic figure he drawn mans power why he has become what he has become we know willards slow decay will parallel kurtzs,10
Apocalypse Now,marlon brando has been revered decades his presence unmatchable his genius undeniable but those unacquainted his acting prowess unaccustomed his physical nuance brando can perceived eyes uncompromising filmgoer hack he most certainly not brando difficult work hard interpret impossible understand but his talent unintelligible rants unparalleled monologues irrefutable man obviously knew what he doing even if we didnt his colonel kurtz being limitless delusions continual profundity,9
Apocalypse Now,if film any indication journeys into hell than francis ford coppolas actual experience making masterpiece true life account one mans fanatical struggle produce movie reported during films 200 plus day principle photography schedule coppola contemplated suicide film not only undeniable struggle make grueling film watch coppolas sweat blood seep through pores steamy locals his dedication filters through orifices martin sheens haunted soldier willard,10
Apocalypse Now,i can not help but feel warm sense nostalgia type film dawn all original unprecedented films challenged well stimulated were commonplace audacity aside apocalypse now pure filmmaking my respect admiration mr coppola highest order but i shudder return what has become norm todays standards film lack innovation not simply unoriginality world cinema today fact nobody seems care tell story anymore tell one heart but we still have great ones like coppolas masterpiece film which bathed its ability give us something deeper than which we could comprehend,10
Apocalypse Now,depth apocalypse now step into madness killing can disturb loss innocence can unhinge but damage within countless barrages images distress unnerve detach us our everyday world memories plague our deepest thoughts eventually segregates us humanity propels us into realm instinctual savage animalistic if thought killing does not provide sustenance act killing provides man its fundamental catharsis,10
Apocalypse Now,i stated above i think 2000 version film ought treated separately redux not just longer version contains two new important scenes one them french episode adds whole new touch classic movie without breaking atmosphere disturbing overall picture i remember i saw redux first time my whole understanding war vietnam changed how i had go library get update few things also interesting coppola chose year 2000 longer redux my guess he feels movie important today back 1979 he even went trouble making excellent piece art even better order actually make all old fans see new stuff present whole new generation very controversial strong comment one most bloody wars recorded history movie thoughtprovoking indeed but also has visually very beautifully composed screenplay capturing madness chaos war storyline also filled more less obvious metaphors philosophical existential riddles friend mine called most philosophical all movies perhaps overstatement my opinion just very good film about war politics war but i can see there plenty everyone here what im saying its one those movies you likely hear distinctly different opinions about you most probably going think again again about ive seen redux 5 6 7 times always puzzling experience highly recommended,10
Solo: A Star Wars Story,so i am generation who got experience star wars feom beginning standing crazy ling line literally wrapped around local theater back 1977 kid totally unaware i about see movie would become my central interest all my childhood early teens once again adult all these years later able share fandom my own son i liked solo i wouldnt say its my favorite but fun ride evoked feelings i associate stat wars world characters felt right showed us some cool new things about life world living under empire amazing cityscapes corellia felt similar me rogue one modern filmmaking techniques yet convincingly evoking vibes classic star wars world anyway i just wanted put some positive review movie contrast strange wave hate feom fans here i dont really understand i have liked something about every star wars movie there has been some better than others there weaker moments every one sure but none worth irrational seeming hate some people putting out there solo good worth your time if you like star wars just one fans opinion,7
Solo: A Star Wars Story,rogue one my favorite star wars movies alden ehrenreich so good movie han solo love whole sequence him trying escape planet kira beginning one my favorite scenes star wars when you see han solo fighting side empire mimban some best 7 minutes star wars whole kessel run sequence good just not my favorite 3rd act unique shoot out small room love twist enfys nest han actually kinda started rebellion stand out characters include han chewie lando tobias beckett love whole conveyex robbery scene love new star wars vehicles troopers some standouts include heavy tie fighter conveyex imperial hauler mud trooper mimban trooper range trooper just such fun ride pace so good,9
Solo: A Star Wars Story,anyone who feels discouraged reviews i tell you theyre not complaining about movie theyre complaining because they feel abused continous stream movies beloved franchise seems ironic i know but having nothing so long suddenly watching different posters every six months has confusing bound raise some eyebrows however we have look objectively simple possible if you love movies you want watch many movies you can if you love star wars you love experience star wars story so all backlash having so much thing you love simply tantrum i hate see so many my fellow star wars fans,9

Solo: A Star Wars Story,i liked solo much more than i anticipated i would like many people posting reviews i am oldschool diehard fan original trilogy i am also fan old extended universe much which now being overshadowed cashgrab new disneydriven galaxy,7
Solo: A Star Wars Story,however i must say negativity film has received undeserved story solid if bit predictable times dialogue acting far better than any other recent star wars films except perhaps rogue one notably comparison last jedi story has logical flow there no sidestories make no sense nor any hamhanded attempts milk humor out unrealistic scene i cant say enough movie actually makes sense has believable story,8
Solo: A Star Wars Story,if there problem star wars becoming another marvel universe where everything has already been done one way another nonstar wars fans will perfectly serviceable actionscifi adventure characters whose struggles most people should recognize other stories these genres i pleasantly surprised how some characters were killed actually made me worry anyone could danger even knowing impossible emotionally real,10
Solo: A Star Wars Story,star wars fans there heaps references extended universe these were done way made sense gave service old star wars stories teras kasi aurra sing chewy being 200 years old among others there glimpses what every day life average citizen empire would experience spoiler not nice han character played true form guy who has seen some bad things done some bad things but still deep down good,9
Solo: A Star Wars Story,i liked dont listen fanatical homers whose own selfabsorption star wars prevents them enjoying anything doesnt conform their predetermined view,6
Solo: A Star Wars Story,im big star wars fan watched empire strikes back cinema when i 8 years old i loved movie empire strikes back rogue one my favorite series,8
Solo: A Star Wars Story,movie itself my opinion its solid adventure movie style great indiana jones movies lots fun intense action witty dialogues great humor solid acting all actors,6
Solo: A Star Wars Story,yes han must meet certain wookie obtain certain spaceship meet certain curly hair character maintain coherence past movies but necessary scenes even if expected still brilliantly developed top these scenes there several surprising scenes run gamut best what star wars universe offers chases spacecraft battles shootouts aliens galore lots lots anti laws physics splitsecond solutions,10
Solo: A Star Wars Story,still my favorite take movie they finally managed shoot amazing movie far epic goodevil battles previous star wars movies completely tune han solo character btw i think alden ehrenreich perfect match role,6
Solo: A Star Wars Story,summary if you think movie unnecessary not needed will indeed disappoint you i would advice you not watch but if you go watch noexpectations open mind i think youll greatly pleased much entertained,10
Solo: A Star Wars Story,my excuses any english mistakes my mother tongue spanish,5
Solo: A Star Wars Story,better than i feared would solo different type star wars film which i welcome no lightsabres no mention force no big climactic battle alden ehrenreich passable soloi found myself warming him towards end emilia clarke completely wooden most memorable thing about woody harrelson his bad wig effects excellent you would expect set pieces train heist kessel run end fight paul bettany good only middlesags because clarkes poor acting worth watch,8
Solo: A Star Wars Story,expected film has been met huge criticism which my opinion wholly unjust just another opportunity so called star wars fans voice their disapproval disney solo not biggest boldest sw feature any stretch but true original trilogy material without resorting overly complicated plots ropey cgi effects forced comedy provides action excitement great dialogue romance vast array alien creatures were lacking rogue 1 genuinely feels like sw film albeit interesting western inspired spin its star wars everything we love about saga if you hate perhaps its time you realised you might not sw fan after all,6
Solo: A Star Wars Story,good origin story not just made up fans took my girlfriend see who has not seen any star wars films she understood enjoyed defiantly recommendation dont listen haters cant wait sequel,1
Solo: A Star Wars Story,nice adventure star wars universe no more no less i enjoyed most movie negativity page disturbingwhat did you guys expect anthology film ehrenreich does decent jobthe story least ok contains nice surprise end,1
Solo: A Star Wars Story,gone time when aloof mysterious character like han solo can stand his own when pure imagination fans opened up countless debates how kessel run really went down how hans eventually won millennium falcon eventually became staple his character hard truth fans casual viewers already knew these milestones hans story happened will happen so only thing mattered about movie how going happen,1
Solo: A Star Wars Story,awhile magic star wars not knowing what expect getting analyze entire livedin universe yourself your friends throughout years solo magic lost you know you will dealing limited stakes since solo chewie pretty much okay surely alive after movie you know will hit basic story beats how he becomes outlaw rebel eventually iconic smuggler secret heart gold we all know love you know hell get falcon you know hell end up leia anyway theres no mystery here everyone knows answer were all left awkward suspicions about how things will play out,1
Solo: A Star Wars Story,alden ehrenreich does most part fantastic job han solo he makes role his own probably one better parts movie lando donald glover chewie both get their moments also stand out their roles beckett woody harrelson qira emilia clarke weirdly fall flat new additions solo aside obvious wisecracking droid entertain us give us some emotional moments two side characters meant people influence title character bland uninteresting beckett seems just ticket han go follow him wherever he goes only just ride backseat mission end while qira plays love interest han who we never get know much about aside pointless explicit exposition she also has vague messy arc makes not just han but audience confused well one point youre not sure where her allegiance lies what her motivations what drives her stick stay away han,9
Solo: A Star Wars Story,moreover story really doesnt aim tell properly structured narrative instead felt like hans biggest hits montage all through out now not say its hard impossible tell proper movie about iconic personsevents we probably know about andor have learned about theorized ourselves rogue one 2016 able do admittedly better extent quite masterfully james bond reboot casino royale back 2006 use casino royale example its perfect story shows how james bond became james bond we know love commanding suave rough 007 agent when movie starts hes not yet quite bond were used know yet but what happens film contributes why he changes then end thats only time we get iconic line james bond introducing himself because character has earned through context film while solo tried achieve same level success falls hard its knees really hard process definition context filmmakers had mind solo just throwing fan service after fan service what made han solo iconic but we never really see why character film particular earned iconic status han basically same person beginning till end compare james bond casino royale wherein his relationship vesper how ended changed his character forever inevitably giving strong emotional narrative context why he became how he never explored film instead becomes bythenumbers monotone dull looking film,1
Mary Poppins,how good mary poppins i remember singing lets go fly kite my then four year old son when we first got nowlost video he now young man little brother teenager i am going buy dvd their children who may not born ten more years ill watch myself until then its good we all have opinions mine long list disney classics masterpieces one top perfect combination story song characters actors whimsy  you name i believe one best movies ever made any genre,9
Mary Poppins,need proof how many songs can you hum car sing shower chim chim cheree spoonful sugar supercalifragilisticexpialidocious thank god copy paste lets go fly kite what about songs put lump your throat tear your eye feed birds great composing great fit story julie andrews good singer you will find,10
Mary Poppins,more proof what about delightful scenes tea party ceiling fox hunt merrygoround horses dancing rooftops london,9
Mary Poppins,memorable characters bert even his horrible accent blast old mr dawes uncle albert mrs banks independent woman long did not annoy mr banks jane michael having experience lifetime poor mr banks so concerned being lord his castle but learning important lessons nick time his illusion control begins unravel moment poppins woman walked door he never figures out who she how she did him,8
Mary Poppins,neither do we really she both cause much madness but stability within story moves along one disneys greatest talents craft movies stories operate multiple levels children love dancing penguins fireworks adults may well but they can register message here what truly important life poppins has answers better we dont analyze who she  course she never explains anything banks family just glad she there while we should glad walt disney left us masterpiece,10
Mary Poppins,julies film debut began worlds love affair herand what marvelous vehicle doing so julie appears here fine voice radiantly beautiful,10
Mary Poppins,performance more than deserving oscar especially considering she had act blue screens objectscharacters within her imagination no easy task certainly,10
Mary Poppins,i also love way julie mary refuses acknowledge freeforall going around her she simply pushes her hair primly back place presses despite dancing chimney sweeps giggling uncles surround her i never explain anything she blithely comments,10
Mary Poppins,score one my favorites all disney canon sherman brothers outdid themselves stay awake one most underappreciated lullabys ever written hauntingly winsome feed birds,9
Mary Poppins,disney animators have created visual feast bottomless surprising mary poppins carpetbag peter ellenshaw matte shots breathtaking my favorite visual moments bert marys liveaction reflections pond eddied family cartoon geese i also love when bert mary children ascend staircase constructed only chimney smoke brilliant,7
Mary Poppins,there few drawbacks films little overlong especially final third where marys but afterthought all plot resolution addition van dyke excellent choice his singing dancing popularity but his cockney accent does grate after while,9
Mary Poppins,but all all tour de force all involved,9
Mary Poppins,mary poppins one select group films can truly called classic project conceived love filled so much childlike wonder will never grow old outofdate certainly crowning achievement walt disneys remarkable career both storywise technically film remains unsurpassed achievement,10
Mary Poppins,based pl travers tales magical nanny who arrives bring families closer rights stories had been pursued disney since 1938 but travers had seen what studios had done other authors works withheld her approval unless she could maintain some creative control years negotiations only whetted disneys desire make definitive truly special film 1960 despite box office failure another fantasythemed pet project darby ogill little people he more confident than ever storys potential bringing together remarkable array talent including songwriting brothers richard robert sherman production head bill walsh brilliant artist peter ellenshaw visualize 1910 london through his matte paintings,8
Mary Poppins,travers grudging approval casting began while american stage tv star dick van dyke odd choice play cockney chimneysweep he gifted mime physical comedian had such wholesome exuberance disney knew british audiences would forgive his shaky accent popular british actors glynis johns david tomlinson would play preoccupied parents karen dotrice matthew garber three lives thomasina neglected children veteran stars ed wynn elsa lanchester reginald owen arthur treacher jane darwell bird woman her last screen appearance headed strong supporting cast,9
Mary Poppins,but casting julie andrews her first film mary poppins truly made film passed over jack warner movie version her stage hit my fair lady he opted audrey hepburn disney caught her performance camelot broadway knew instantly she right mary approached her role but im pregnant she told him no problem he replied ill wait,10
Mary Poppins,thus classic born,8
Mary Poppins,multiple 1964 oscar winner including best actress andrews who got share stage her lady costar rex harrison who won best actor film major hit worldwide quickly achieved legendary status holds today,10
Mary Poppins,songs both silly sublime seamless intermeshing live performers animation only disney studio time capable undeniable magnetism andrews van dyke nearly impossible not like mary poppins,8
Mary Poppins,its hard me explain connection i feel film i 7 when came out saw twice theaters time course have seen over over since then im going get 40th anniversary dvd soon you can argue about dick van dyke playing englishman about julie andrews being too sweet young compared character literature about fact whole thing obviously shot soundstage but just imagine being 7 8 9 10 anywhere near there not getting out your small town rust belt us except maybe few times year holidays you can imagine what seeing magical albeit disneyfied look another world must have been like every time i see i think back beautiful old movie theater which i saw block away catholic school i then attended no less getting my mother buy certain box cereal so i could get mary poppins prize inside gathering weekends cousins listen soundtrack try dance like bert ive been london many times since then but funny enough much great city has offer ive never been able find magical place i saw 40 years ago,7
Mary Poppins,although i loved film upon first seeing theater 64 wasnt until i adult i began appreciate amazed sophistication writing sure special effects music visuals what grab attention but script itself lyrics offer just much brilliance i would even assert isnt childrens film all but film aimed adults under guise kids film type subversion exactly what youd expect mary poppins her method day one use reverse psychology anyone she trying manipulatein good sense course she teaches children give money poor suggesting they feed birds she gets them fall asleep sweetly singing stay awake she gets mr banks take kids him work acting if his idea complimenting him thinking spoonful sugar helps medicine go down,10
Mary Poppins,films main character dramatically speaking not mary nor children father george banks after all he one who makes films primary transformation brought about presence mary poppins she there show him his children more important than money his job once she has completed her task she moves sort message adults audience need learn not children,10
Bad Education,movie much more than famous early 21st century scandal actors chosen portray their respective roles undoubtedly best placed every moment,7
Bad Education,me movie not just about embezzlement funds but more than two minutes agony dr frank tassonehugh jackman had against system world highlight although shown negative character i could empathise actions taken public school teacher how frustrating part system where people instead appreciating their mentors forget move their lives,9
Bad Education,movie about mindset people public service develop overtime which what compels them do things even they consider heinous frsutrated person tries reason out himself his actions justified what drills him deeper into abyss negligence which unable crawl out,9
Bad Education,all comes down role we expected play world we often forget small yet significant contribution some people our lives why we should appreciate people who help us becoming who we today otherwise other dr franks wont have option but repeat history again again,10
Bad Education,i uninterested watching movie but thought i would give shot given its based true story allison janney amazing hugh jackman delivers great performance geraldine viswanathan stellar always but entire cast great truly beginning film tells story captivating compelling ways momentum builds over course hundred minutes edge your seat storytelling could have been made into miniseries its just good do yourself favor see,7
Bad Education,fabulous performance superb acting all cast members wonderful direction beautifully written,6
Bad Education,loved film great script direction fantastic acting also film message today suburban school seeking 1 its district enamored deceived their charming superintendent schools lots twists interesting characters well done thoughtful film,7
Bad Education,greetings again darkness trust our national institutions may alltime low but its not like there havent been plenty events over years make us wary enough demand attention oversight story 2002 nassau county schools scandal prime example director corey finleys follow up his clever twisted thoroughbreds 2018 script writer mike makowski who student district when scandal hit,9
Bad Education,hugh jackman plays dr frank tassone district superintendent schools while oscar winner allison janney i tonya pam gluckin assistant superintendent both excellent but mr jackman delivers what might his best ever performance his tassone ubercharming clearly wants best schools students we do notice some oddities about him he seems overly concerned about his physical attractiveness perfect business suits facelifts not hair out place big smiles show world he has all under control contrast if ms janneys pam had mustache she would certainly twirl storys most obvious villain,6
Bad Education,film opens informing us district has been evaluated doing excellent terms student test scores student admissions prestigious schools raising property values area financial success leads new construction project one appears more ego project than substantive education ray romano plays president school board we get glimpses life school challenges faced administrators many things if all well few questions asked,8
Bad Education,however stuff hits fan when reporter school paper starts doing some basic research rachel geraldine viswanathan blockers writing fluff piece new high dollar capital improvement project school when she stumbles irregularities billing turns out ms gluckin has been embezzling years when discrepancies first come light conversations school board administrators downright fascinating crime obvious but going public who does help who does hurt these people dont want kids lose opportunities they dont want their property values drop they dont want bad publicity comes being unaware fraud had been ongoing under their watch,7
Bad Education,once ms gluckins scheme has been exposed jackman really kicks into gear tassone any additional details would spoil fun but becomes clear hes master manipulator corrupt people have way convincing themselves their actions justified given good work they do you know drill underappreciated underpaid solid support work comes david bhargava rachels father who also going through his own professional crisis alex wolff editor school paper he faces his own moral dilemma scene where he knows right thing do will actually cause harm his college opportunity finally rafael casal stars kyle bartenderdancer former student tassone they reunited las vegas,7
Bad Education,director finley cinematographer lyle vincent throughbreds girl who walks home alone night shoot harsh light never allowing truth hide behind soft filters these complex people real lives real families real friends all doing good things students watching compromise morals twisting ethics always bit uncomfortable but film shows just how easy we can overlook obvious film features brisk pacing some dark humor moments least deserve humor trailer bit misleading comedy quite dark nature lowkey approach filmmaking provides none overthetop dramatic flair we expect instead its social commentary psychological study pathological liars manipulators positions bring public trust,8
Bad Education,movie takes lot time get really started which makes bit boring hugh jackman good his role but hes done better before categorized comedy which definetely not,7
Bad Education,great cast great story strong creative script interesting story corruption surprisingly large scale underfunded education field nice work showing many sides main characters unlike most movies keep everything black white allison janney killed again one problem tho they could focus more ordinary teachers lead poor lives how major spit their faces,5
Bad Education,i have always found hbos content either incredibly well produced horribly stupid bad education smart film but carried solely cast plot does shed light into current state public school system america but without hugh jackman ray romano allison janney film would have fallen its face dry material elevated entertainment educational value enough social commentary make anyone question current state education america,9
Bad Education,hugh jackman great allison janney great ray romano ok usual said movie desperate some sort entertainment value moderately boring start finish i found myself hoping something going break open because film did not deviate truth suffered bit big short had its comedic moments wolf wall street had very interesting main character work film however didnt really have right source content produce truly entertaining piece cinema bad movie no not long shot fine there some good character development along way cinematography handled well when movie over i just left feeling native long islander my mid 30s film didnt offer much i didnt know about story already decent flick just not necessarily everyone,6
Bad Education,solid refreshing script brilliant direction hugh jackman gave awardwinning performance my rating 810,9
Bad Education,bad education movie based true story americas largest school theft scandal 11 million dollars roslyn school district prime suspects frank tassone pam gluckin played hugh jackman allision gluckin respectively frank tassone superintendent roslyn district schools who genuinely cares about students does whats best their students remembers everyones name overly concerned about his physical appearance pam glukin hardworking trusted individual everything goes smoothly until student investigates funds her school article,7
Bad Education,bad education absolutely captivating some first 30 min might seem little boring fact nothing happens we dont know whats happening just builds characters sets environment after movie jumps instantly hooks until end movie we see another side characters unfolding story through student journalist screenplay how story unravels interestingly wrote mike makowsky after seeing movie surprised know only second directorial film cory finley did good job,10
Bad Education,hugh jackman easily best part movie his charisma deep acting facial expressions movie progresses he changes shades character really given masterclass acting not only movie real hugh jackman worked teacher also remembers his students name we all know how nice guy me best acting hugh after les miserables 2012 prisoners 2013 alison janneys performance amazing,7

Bad Education,thanks reading🙃,1
Aladdin,soon live action version aladdin first announced seems certain people were against while i too have fond memories seeing original animated version theatre i least willing give one chance im glad i did firstly people need realise animated film liveaction film two different things some things work animation just wont translate too well into liveaction other thing accept short resurrecting robin williams there no way they were ever going able replicate his unique take character genie once you open your mind possibility something can different but also good then youll have more pleasant experience thats what we get here movie familiar but same time newdifferent thats not bad thing,8
Aladdin,very beginning movie somewhat different what we might expecting when were introduced who telling story while immediately evident me what going wasnt bad addition after sweeping shots set song arabian nights were introduced street rat named aladdin although much fuss has been made about genie casting if aladdin had been miscast then whole film wouldve suffered thankfully i can say i almost immediately liked mena massoud role hes funny got movescharm makes likeable thief his relationship his pet monkey abu good id hoped itd speaking although people think cgi characters badly lot time must made clear animal companions all wonderfully brought lifefullyrealised characters abu expressive funny helpful despite sometimes getting them both into trouble,3
Aladdin,not before long aladdin encounters princess jasmine wellcast naomi scott who does lot character should make most jasmine fans proud whos undercover among people i afraid movie would rush through their first meeting but happy amount time devoted them developing interest each other i could instantly tell beloved character jasmine safe hands portrayed naomi scott she had nice chemistry massouds aladdin although not given much do abu jasmines loyal tiger companion rajah another lovely animal created cgi who i appreciated wasnt largely ignored jasmines other loyal friend her handmaiden named dalia actually standout character movie nasim pedrad has excellent comic timing does naomi scott which full display fun scene where aladdin comes palace jasmine attempts maintain her cover,1
Aladdin,one miss casting department marwan kenzari villainous jafar while others had prejudged him based trailers alone i willing give him chance make up his lack sinister voice what would hopefully least menacing performance sadly he lacks even theres nothing particularly memorable about his portrayal even near end when hes given every opportunity unleash fullon villain mode he falls way short about only positive i could find regarding his character his animal companion iago red parrot might not quite talkative animated version but he does talk much more birdlike way getting few funny lines here there id expect nothing less alan tudyk providing voice its just disappointing jafars miscast thus weak link film,3
Aladdin,what most people probably wondering about will smith genie i actually thought he pretty good here i found him more likeable role than i have any movie ive seen him since probably first men black there just one two instances where i felt he tried emulate robin williams version didnt quite work but whole i felt he brought his own energystyle character genie mostly worked most important thing friendship he formed aladdin while smiths genie may seem bit more snarky than you might expect when comes emotional beats his performance hits right notes especially near end,8
Aladdin,speaking notes what about songs you may ask i pretty happy them there were just right amount they didnt feel particularly intrusive any scenes they were featured even new song speechless isnt too bad though there those wholl no doubt complain massoud scott have really nice singing voices did their songs justice i thought will smiths also decent his main songs movie end credits one i couldve done without though,1
Aladdin,i must also praise costumes jasmines all stunning jasmine herself use vibrant colours quite impressive overall look film feels like something newdifferent what weve seen time time again films especially disney ones things i forgot mention magic carpet has much character original i especially appreciated seeing how close friends carpet abu became end even sultans head guard hakim given some depth,3
Aladdin,conclusion if you go into theatre already dislikinghating film based just trailers then youre probably going leave same way you entered bitter thinking things like ruined my childhood such rubbish statement just try accepting different thing hopefully youll enjoy,2
Aladdin,i left cringing during each musical sequence due blatant over use autotune actors bring no emotion story,2
Aladdin,whats say before even filming we knew guy ritchie obviously wrong choice direct film his style doesnt quite lend itself type film miscast mena massoud didnt bring any real character role aladdin he simply okay functional will smith usual charismatic had difficult shoes fill after robin williams take genie but he seriously let down vfx blue genie mode weak script another miscast naomi scott gave good performance but i always felt i looking indian not middle eastern fact film very bollywood jasmin aladdin dance off indian style indian music then russian dancing plus other times indian soundtrack im not even going talk about sorry excuse villain no no i am not disney movie set large kingdom sure does feel quite quite small looked cheap too weird ultimately dreadfully executed cash grab movie no one asked thanks d thankfully exactly what i expected having seen trailers,1
Aladdin,why do i have jeff goldblum sort feeling about these new live action movies,1
Aladdin,disney tried so hard see if thy could do live action version animated classics they never stopped ask themselves if they should,2
Aladdin,damn i always disagreed goldblums character but maybe he right,2
Aladdin,like many disney live action adaptations film utterly fails understand what made original so great begin moments character growth interaction feel rushed changed up original yet outcome story still illogically remains same some additional scenes around new characters simply feel laughable out place additional song written film heavily clashes musical style existing ones instrumental accompaniment songs general sounds too modern not like classical musical anymore humor movie very hit miss some lines moments indeed extremely enjoyable while most others seem too forced vfx film not entirely up task will undoubtedly look dated few years time most importantly overall spectacle feels much less impactful than originals overall there would much more go into but should enough summary,9
Aladdin,i know everyone wants compare animated version but dont take comes you will thoroughly enjoy does stay pretty faithful animated version i think will smith genie could never robyn williams genie but i dont think he tries he does fantastically well his own right absolutely loved prince ali song where aladdin enters city prince brilliantly colorful spectacle captured really well jafar missed little me had lost smarmyness animated version songs were great aladdin jasmine characterization pretty spot i think kids would love i would definitely recommend,1
Aladdin,talk about wrong cast cheap visual effects childhood favorite mine really looking forward seeing come big screen again if you into indian movies bollywood i assume you might like isnt indian folklore people why would you direct cast such way where aladdin keeps you edge your seat excitement where story telling keeps you enticed pulls you into movie where wonder cave wonders where feeling flying magic carpet where aladdin we all can relate inspires us better where family relationship we can all relate nowherethats problem movie rushed why productiondirection so bad there not enough budgeting were you guys deadline will smith amazing actor always carried movie onto big screen but he isnt robin william i actually laughing most time lines i honestly hope not all disney remake movies going done same standards,1
Aladdin,you know how sometimes you hear someone try retell joke they just totally butcher thats what happened here great story but terrible story telling end day bad joke,1
Aladdin,i have only ever walked out one movie before would have been second one if wasnt fact i end row didnt want disturb two young families so boring yet should have been so good,9
Aladdin,there were so many chances missed its set arabia yes sets scenery were amazing but we never got chance enjoy them film kept skipping scene scene little no shots anything apart actors should have could have been both magical beautiful couldnt we have seen jasmin explore city little before bumping aladdin also would have made her character more rounded show us how trapped she palace,1
Aladdin,i totally fell love aladdin animated film had teenage crush him years yes ok hes animated character i know but dont judge me aladdin lacked animated versions spark determination worst all kindness he briefly hands child some dates thats about we dont get see why he helps jasmin market its all too rushed so their relationship never really feels real left me really not caring whether they ended up together not,1
Aladdin,songs whilst sung quite well didnt seem fit into film every time one them burst into song felt false like had been crowbarred,1
Aladdin,all all real disappointment left me grieving what might have been,2
Aladdin,exception will smith whom i have always liked actor movie cgi will never compare original robin williams i am soooo tired hollywood remaking movies make more money inner circle nothing creative anymore its simply about making money its just regurgitation hollywood no longer creative some small exceptions clearly business remaking movies over over again,2
Aladdin,animation one my all time favourite disney films full laughs heart emotion incredible story just total mess lead actor so incredibly wooden emotionless only good thing going him his fantastic dance moves maybe stick now will smith good but forgettable i totally get he trying make his own but im sorry nothing can out do robin williams unfortunately thats what film would have needed make great someone even better than original actor plays jafar next awful not menacing enough makes very lacklustre performance naomi scott other hand absolutely brilliant jasmine her voice when she sings speechless gave me goosebumps she only reason i gave 2 stars instead 1 maybe disney needs stop live action now im really dreading lion king mulan now theyre both 2 more favourites fingers crossed,10

Deadpool 2,its true you can have too much good thingplease no more different editions,7
Deadpool 2,theatrical cut best version any cuts most cleanly edited had best soundtrack out three clear after seeing all versions film they tested all jokes ones included were cherry picked best were picked included one,8
Deadpool 2,super duper cutextended supposed extended version film but actually different cutwhat i mean they changed soundtrack they cut out what i considered some funniest jokes theatrical cut replaced them they also added some additional footage film after making those changes version film feels darker less funny me personally so i prefer theatrical cut over,9
Deadpool 2,once upon deadpoolpg13 edition nobody asked most unnecessary editing standpoint version film very sloppy seems like one giant montage they dont even start version film out beginning jumps right into safe room scene lot footage included edition already available home releases online apart short amount filmed fred savage movie would end up edited tv regardless edition existing not so reality there no need edition exist apart making more money,9
Deadpool 2,deadpool great movie filed lot jokes however above age 18 since contains lot bad words first movie deadpool i did not like lot however second one great movie first one because did not have lot meaning hidden just marvel movie however second one opposite its main idea love reason i liked second one more,10
Deadpool 2,i loved deadpool 2016 i blown away reynolds commitment character fantastic,6
Deadpool 2,i however heartbroken when i saw first trailer sequel looked pants not just pants i mean granny pants 15yr old torn badly stained 4 different shades granny pants,8
Deadpool 2,ive never been so happy about being wrong deadpool 2 delivers easily comparable quality first movie i sure hell did not expect,9
Deadpool 2,fantastic new additions all returning cast excellent cameos deadpool sequel i desired but didnt expect possibly deserve,9
Deadpool 2,its brand over top violence quick fire humour endless pop culture references reynolds role he born play deadpool 2 worthy sequel franchise i dont ever want end if continues like,8
Deadpool 2,so damn funny i cant wait see what they do third movie concept however bringing deadpool into existing marvel universe though fills me dread how could deadpools brand r rated goodness possibly fit into disney universe dontdo,4
Deadpool 2,good,8
Deadpool 2,cast fantastic again,2
Deadpool 2,so damn funny,4
Deadpool 2,action packed,1
Deadpool 2,soundtrack random may,1
Deadpool 2,incredible during credits scenes,1

Deadpool 2,some questionable casting choices new characters,1
Deadpool 2,things i learnt movie,1
Deadpool 2,everyday should international womans day,1
Deadpool 2,vinnie jones all grown up,1
Deadpool 2,i didnt think dp2 could possibly funnier than first bigger budget helps but everything writing directing course actors make quite film its all action hilarity first scene last im not gonna spoil movie grabs you starting credits until screen goes black not made children,10
Deadpool 2,your going hard pressed find movie more over top than deadpool 2 david leitch takes whole new level entirely works namely because violence here just creative sure defies all logic most time but i laughing having riproaring time throughout,9
Fantasy Island,i almost didnt go see movie after reading reviews but i had two hours kill so i did all people who gave terrible reviews crazy people were claiming they couldnt follow plot but i didnt have any problem all fact i rather enjoyed myself now movie will not win any oscars but neither will listed among worst all time either watch movie notion you will not see cinematic masterpiece but instead will able spend two hours where magical islands exist tv show lost had similar plot one most successful shows all time watch movie same mindset,7
Fantasy Island,oscar worthy no but if youre mood nice fun comedy action thriller aok has couple twists keeps you wondering where its going if plot gets little sketchy here there have some more popcorn give bit,8
Fantasy Island,i enjoyed more than many higher rated more pumped movies ive seen lately grab ya bucket nice beverage have little fun one,9
Fantasy Island,i grew up age fantasy island gilligans island love boat era while ill admit i partial latter two i remembered plane boss plane immaculate gentleman white welcoming guests fantasy island out if way fun movie we enjoyed beginning end negative reviews sound like want film critics there no deeper meaning philosophy take away movie its just fun its meant entertainment what would you say about top gun footloose legend labyrinth dark crystal heavy metal gremlins if they came out today those movies were not convey message but entertain which they did not everything has oscar teach you life lesson rant over i recommend movie no cussing nudity crudity senseless stupidity so get your ice man break rules help unicorn break glass ceiling restore balance beat oppressors dont eat after midnight,8
Fantasy Island,what hell do people expect watch popcorn booze few buddies,8
Fantasy Island,people seem rate these types movies badly i am not sure why i think very unique not many movies made about islands manifest your fantasies dark twisted way despite anything should get points creativity secondly thrilling kept you thinking about who behind jt all managed surprise me completely obviously group 56 main characters hard flesh out all their development but even did good job managed get few emotional moments conclusion campy gimmicky horror style its own doesnt deserve rated badly,7
Fantasy Island,i hoping not bored movie looking score 4610 but i amazed mystery must genre not horror there almost no horror inside but so many unexpected things i believe idea great hidden idea even better move deserve least 710 go watch yourself,9
Fantasy Island,if you go expecting see original you will disappointed if you go expecting blum house film you will love plot twist perfectly done villain kept secret yes formulaic but they arent chasing oscars here they creating blum house film they did good job film fun watch entertaining,9
Fantasy Island,movie surprisingly really good everything movie has reason i love when things come full circle everything made sense end gave me goosebumps didnt have some super deep meaning but i still thought interesting really fun watch overall really fun thriller watch my eyes were glued screen whole time,6
Fantasy Island,despite plot holes all over place storyline quite enjoyable first second act but then writer suddenly decided rush third act creating worst plot twist,8
Fantasy Island,i thoroughly enjoyed movie its not worthy oscar but i entertained technically i guess you could call horror movie but wasnt scary i dont like being scared,7
Fantasy Island,group guests arrive fantasy island paradisiacal tropical resort hosted mysterious mr roarke michael peña his staff promise their secret fantasies dreams come true island he interviews each new arrival make clear their fantasies just end when concluded confirm each wish gwen olsen maggie q regrets day she said no proposal her boyfriend melanie cole lucy hale seeks revenge her highschool mate sloane maddison portia doubleday patrick sullivan austin stowell dreams being soldier like his father gay brax weaver jimmy o yang his brother j d weaver ryan hansen just want party but soon they realize there price pay island wishes come true,8
Fantasy Island,fantasy island highly entertaining fantasy film good twists metascore imdb user rating ridiculous misguiding viewers plot combination twilight zone franchise house 1985 not horror movie fortunately i did not read reviews imdb i look forward waiting sequel my vote seven,8
Fantasy Island,title brazil ilha da fantasia fantasy island,8
Fantasy Island,entertaining plot nice acting cast i liked fresh take classic franchise,9
Fantasy Island,too many people here just crybabies behind computer screens get life,8
Fantasy Island,why bad i think very fair movie not predictable there were surprises store its atmosphere really cool i loved,4
Fantasy Island,yes course genre movie kind story will never win golden globe oscar but kind movie you would watch after hard day work your partner your buddies relax little bit,8
Fantasy Island,i have admit movie exceeded my expectations because i expecting careless predictable story cheap jumpscares even though movie had very very few jumpscares were not really creepy story pretty well made i did not predict multiple twists presented,8
Fantasy Island,one most interesting things about movie way how stories main characters intertwine each other way could actually believable person somehow connects all protagonists,8
Fantasy Island,so if you not kind person wants have good time his friends just relax also enjoy movie you should give go i not disappointed i feel like you will not either,1
Fantasy Island,tv show always had undercurrent tension roark beautifully brings surface michael piña stepped into ricardo montalbáns shoes i didnt think possible,6
Fantasy Island,there were actually two movies before tv series but first one basically very similar one famed hunter wanted hunted woman wanted attend her own funeral wwii vet wanted relive his lost romance some way fantasy worked another way things didnt happened movie fantasy ended i really didnt enjoy tv show giving way love boat land did each person finding romance end well i think only one time show did fantasies crossover granted there seemed some bits were tad clunky but end they all came together somewhat connecting hardly worst movie all other posts seem think they did seem along lines what people show always wanted wont give away what happened anybody but together movie do i think sequel would possible possibly,8
Fantasy Island,i must confess i hadnt high expectations about fantasy island because seemed another horror movie same vibe truth dare story interesting makes us think about what we would wish if were island but unfortunately turns little annoying due lack tension violence i just can say film more drama comedy fantasy elements than horror movie,9
Fantasy Island,other problems acting some characters i dont think lucy hale bad actress shes just unlucky about roles she accepts main plot twist doesnt make any sense,7
The Hunger Games,what bitter disappointment order explain what missing film please allow me describe what i love about books,3
The Hunger Games,suzanne collins creates moving portrayal girl living under cruel dictatorship set against background extreme poverty these books show how unequal distribution wealth affects panems society those living wealthy capitol have so little common destitute people districts they regard deaths district children entertainment violence hunger games shocking because brutal unnecessary yet wholly embraced even celebrated capitol residents district tributes they not enemies but they kill each other all same some reluctantly others enthusiasm trilogy progresses becomes compelling commentary madness war sad futility violence however these themes woven into books such way you may not even notice theyre being discussed you become so immersed katnisss world poverty given violence sad but expected part life,7
The Hunger Games,film follows basic storyline but lacks emotional depth character development almost nonexistent deaths arena bloodless every sense word tributes little more than walking stereotypes so their deaths have no impact even rues death heartwrenching book little more than side note movie if i hadnt read books i dont think i would have understood dynamic between tributes all including conflicted relationship between katniss peeta their romance comes across cheesy unconvincing there no hint bond grows between them story progresses,3
The Hunger Games,perhaps my biggest criticism movie no one seems going hungry i cannot believe filmmakers overlooked important point capitols exploitation districts supposed backdrop entire story when katniss arrives capitol observes how food appears touch button she cannot understand how capitol residents fill their time majority her days consumed feeding her family defines her most tributes have never had enough eat major factor games,1
The Hunger Games,beginning movie seemed promising ominous mood district 12 just right apparent people who live there exhausted resigned their fate when residents appear reaping they look like cattle being rounded up slaughter capitol contrast frightening its frenetic artificiality juxtaposition welldone however filmmakers lost me when tributes entered arena,8
The Hunger Games,there no sense tension tributes make all kinds noise they move through woods seemingly oblivious fact they being hunted katniss stands about ten feet away cato he snaps boys neck we supposed believe he doesnt see her scenes control room pointless add nothing movie they should have spent time character development unfortunately lack character development causes emotional scenes fall flat i am astounded even possible given subject matter but overall result lacks intensity depth,10
The Hunger Games,i will credit elizabeth banks excellent portrayal effie trinket she adds humor sense absurdity capitol life donald sutherland also does well president snow jennifer lawrence adequate katniss but josh hutcherson terrible peeta hes just not very likable we see none his inner strength instead he comes across whiny weak wes bentley seems included just showcase his ability grow amazing beard,6
The Hunger Games,one more thing what happened haymitch hes supposed selfdestructive drunk his cunning all more unexpected because he seems incapable taking care himself i thrilled when they cast woody harrelson he does well some parts but seemed like they had water down his character market young adults,4
The Hunger Games,movie had lot potential but fell short many important ways score 310 pretty harsh but i felt though filmmakers kept all plot points none meaning read books instead,1
The Hunger Games,thrillingengaging entertaining dystopian action scifiction flick really liked visuals all action scenes real deal drama action screenplaycostumes make up all decent especially make up movie sets very beautiful elegant which make people novel come life nowconsidering novelthis movie adaption misses few things i wanted see screen one i expected more violent screen r rating but they made pg13 stuff i dont know whyto make more money i guess shaky cinematography too some important messages had been cut down these things really disappoint me because i loved novel wanted more precise other than good popcorn entertainer loved jennifer lawrence though acting far far better than kristennoexpressionstewart not only jennifer but all actors did their job very good now looking forward sequelshope they will better,1
The Hunger Games,ok first let me admit i havent read books i didnt even know they existed i taken cinema my girlfriend who saw something trailers i didnt which made her all excited so i sat there clear mindset no expectations no prejudice no background info whatsoever first things first whoever invented lets shake camera all around because makes movie so much more lifelike convinced others follow him her should shot twice fact just sureit really annoying so unnecessary not making anything more real me many cases hectic jerky camera movement seemed only poor attempt mask fact there nothing not much happening but tries make look intense action packed regardless so cheapand apart pissing me off didnt work all but i admit i well may minority story feels like hanging air again i didnt read books so scenes may have been adequately set there but movie you get 10 lines off you goand doesnt add much depth later either most fundamental question remained whats point sending 2 dozens younglings slaughter wont hold aggression bay itself actually more likely infuriated parents driven mad grieving over unnecessary pointless death their children will cry revenge go into resistance even spark brutal bloodbath especially annual event so sooner later everyone will affected friends family also scale hanging air too you dont know how 2 opposing populations citizens shiny new world habitants 12 district relate each other which would rather pivotal i wont go many potholes bottom line me scene set simply poorly story well very simple straight once you stepped over inadequate surroundings feels painfully unfinished though i dint know there series behind i told rather disappointed missus end must so because they already have sequel mind knowing gives little excuse but still left hollow really kind feeling both us striking similarities battle royal ill leave alone acting ok considering absurdity some characters whole context background story im sorry im not big fan lead actress jennifer lawrence i didnt even know her before movie althogh i saw really liked first class but somehow couldnt connect regardless she does good job portraying transferring tension fear uncertainty situation she pulled into least good number scenes fact her efforts were one few ups me among many downs during long 25 hours kudos elizabeth banks well creating sugarmonster character also fact though i know her face well enough just seen man ledge here i simply couldnt recognise based movie itself i really dont know how can so popular but i admit im probably not target audience also books may much better well wouldnt difficult bar set really low donald sutherland brilliant saying only hope stronger than fear but ms lawrences occasional shine doesnt make worth sacrifice evening i have frequent visitor card so didnt cost me anything but if ive paid almost 10 quids i would rather upset,1

The Hunger Games,start movie so obvious tiny little girl scared out her wits who has no business being hunger games most predictably lead actresses little sister obvious she going take her place even more less surprising we find out boy going her has crush her,5
The Hunger Games,1 hour 15 minutes woody harrelson being not nearly believable enough crude alcoholic become soft hearted lot senseless dinners lot hype contestants we know nothing about absolutely no politics explanation what hunger games actually how came about awful underlying message sent out viewers just yourself but do what everyone expects katniss went being tough weak sleepy survivor,8
The Hunger Games,you bored yet so they get thrown out into hunger games there absolutely no build up whatsoever only person you know out there katniss boy who came her rest contestants you dont know hardly have clue what theyre capable most them die start anyway katniss runs away initial slaughter take nap then she takes more naps one point out blue she finds herself middle fiery doom fireballs launching her she barely survives well lucky her though we were never told she has some sponsors save her help silent montage woody harrelson laughing bunch poorly dressed somebodies she gets saved super healing medicine she takes more naps,7
The Hunger Games,later we find out boy who has crush her teamed up last jerks some reason game where only one survives there people who travel groups okay why they make some pathetic attempts kill her then give up sleep kat makes new friend who seems most resourceful herbal expert she tells her dump bunch insects them then while takes forever her saw tree limb off were told these evil dangerous insects will kill you how convenient she gets stung few times conveniently kills girl bow arrows which just so happens shes expert how lucky too bad she stung these insects now shes going take more naps saved somehow tiny girl who knows herbal remedies wish we would have known they turn out good pals what surprise well after lot more boring stuff not getting know anything about what going they randomly decide go find out what meanies up,2
The Hunger Games,turns out they gathered all supplies somehow found bunch land mines surround pile okay whats supposed do apparently some girl isnt part their group she expertly dodges every land mine gets away something so instead gathering some supplies katniss blows all up then runs away katniss her little pal find each other but get attacked kat swiftly dodges spear throw sticks attacker arrow attacker dies instantly but finds out poor little girl stuck big spear except takes forever her die we dont know anything about character so we dont care so long drawn out death stupid,3
The Hunger Games,well kat runs off alone finds her boy who has crush her some reason untold hes not group anymore hes badly injured somehow okay they hobble off after way too long then find cave where takes way too long them get things going she decides go off her own some supplies gets attacked girl who takes too long kill her but some other guy out blue saves katniss absolutely no reason then just leaves her alone game where only one survives perfect opportunity turn odds his favor just leaves her alone she goes back takes lot more time finds out there only one person left really thanks showing us some action but anyway they leave cave hunger game techs people whatever they unleash bunch dogs really big full muscle kat her boyfriend outrun all them huge metal platform where theyre surrounded blood thirsty animals who could easily make jump top platform dont instead last guy whoever he bloody looks like he can barely move beats crap out both them how he got dogs beyond me but whoever can do must amazing until kat shoots him hand arrow causes him fall off get eaten dogs but kat feels sorry him puts him out his misery,1
The Hunger Games,after there nothing really note nobody says anything important nobody cares they just wish would end because they dont really know what happened all they dont really know anybody but kat donald sutherland gives some meaningless scornful look walks off credits roll,1
The Hunger Games,future all wars have ended but famine poverty still remain new north amercia which has been split into 12 districts appease people pay tribute fallen capitol city have devised hunger games which 2 children each district chosen fight death live tv,1
The Hunger Games,film follows fortunes two chosen district 12 we see them whisked off capitol city pastel coloured willy wonka style place which people wear outlandish costumes have bizarre haircuts live seemingly empty decedent lives here they treated like royalty trained readiness games,6
The Hunger Games,eventually children pitted against each other game begin here film begins remind one japanese classic few years back battle royale but without much blood violence game progresses rules begin change attain ending which pleasing masses rather than those playing game new elements thrown ensure excitement fun viewers,5
The Hunger Games,film takes long time really hit its stride opening sequences seemingly go forever there no doubt film owes big debt battle royale well nods original rollerball much war has been outlawed violence has become controlled organised entertainment masses even logans run but has enough make standup worthwhile film its own right not least these way which tv shown become cynical exploitative where much same way ancient romans had their blood circuses love death merely elements mass entertainment,1
The Hunger Games,production very good future capitol city looks amazing whilst acting ranges excellent young actress playing lead role very good screen chewing woody harrleson eats his heart out other thing about film its length almost 2hours 30minutes there no doubt just too long good half hour could have been lost without losing any tension drama worth seeing definitely but make sure you watch comfortable cinema else take cushion,1
First Cow,film super slow story interesting but not even enough fill one hour let alone two hours,5
First Cow,camera work scenery great period settings look good but i cannot confirm because i not there,4
First Cow,other than story simple no excitement anything special about,8
First Cow,editor which incidentally also director should have cut 90 minutes alas i did skip through many dull parts disappointed ending which hinted but did not really explain beginning,2
First Cow,mediocre attempt romantic story about friendship hardships life frontier,7
First Cow,acting cinematography were superb but almost excruciatingly slow i felt like id been cheated outcome whole film im sure director could direct good watchable film unfortunately wasnt quite,10
First Cow,positive surprise first film feels doesnt know where goes shows very detailed introduction its two protagonists but detail key word newest feature kelly reichardt visuals extremely detailed so characters general we get lot information just watching them their daily lives slowly plot thickens has some unexpected turns kelly reichardt really did fantastic job telling story she proves fantastic eye visuality showing off some fantastic nature shots really add lot atmosphere film she did everything right film although she might once while loses herself little bit too much her details actors were wisely chosen leading roles filled rather unknown actors who usually secondary roles first all there john magaro who very subtle effective better performance came orion lee who extremely charismatic does lot role given him i think he might have very interesting future i loved how he handled role gave many different facettes there good supporting performance toby jones who does wonders his rather one dimensional character ewen bremner bit wasted but not much lily gladstone which insulting gladstone brilliant reichardts previous film ended up my top 5 supporting actresses so i shocked how misused she film but thats just one very few flaws film another very positive note goes score which fantastic mentioned before cinematography give try try read less possible about so you have chance perfectly soak into,2
First Cow,nothing happens dragged bunch nothingness except two pelters ealier times steal some milk rich mans cow sell some cookies high price rich man eventually finds out runs them off could have been 5 minutes rather then 2 hours your time 2 hours i am not getting back,1
First Cow,oregon territory 1800s cookie hooks up king lu they strike rich making fried dough stealing milk only cow town their sin they pay thats folks doesnt sound like much but definitely has feel mccabe mrs miller warren beatty film 70s anyway its very atmospheric its like being there not action buffs but if you love movies go,2
First Cow,god boredom its no wonder director who brought you certain women also put out dud first cow about engaging listing some bore drone length about nothing npr cbc radio unless you want fall asleep theatre like i did you can give one miss,1
First Cow,marvelous film leaves out all parts unnecessary includes real life bits pieces add up wonderful story highlights value generosity creativity while also unflinchingly telling story hard life frontier intensity hunger world value food beautifully exhibited,8
First Cow,wow when i woke up i started watching dirtmuch more exciting than whatever,6
First Cow,walking along woodsperhaps alone perhaps friend human canineyou spot tiny flash color doesnt belong precipitate silvery brightness lost spoon toovivid red orange plastic toy abandoned maybe friend if theyre canine variety spots sniffs something out place begins worry shaking off leaves soil years have built up around since dropped set down through one lens such things garbage destined nearest bin through another theyre piece some unknown story playing out some other time someone makes such discovery earliest moments kelly reichardts transfixing first cowand yes good dog involvedbut nature discovery makes impossible deny second lens story cries out soil echoes past reverberating forth pristine whiteness bone two skeletons lie earth curled together if still seeking warmth theres story there alright,8
First Cow,first cow adapted reichardt frequent collaborator jonathan raymond latters novel half life many things simultaneously gentle unsparing dissection formative flaws capitalism thus american dream frontier story which captures harsh realities simple pleasures life built painstakingly rock wood soil heist movie argument power baked goods somehow both brutal pastoral peaceful laced through inevitability disaster death nothing fragile can hold forevernot tree branch not ruse not luck not peace no matter what william tylers beautiful serene score might trick you into believing but above all else story friendship treated here haven basic human need essential water bread film begins quote william blakes proverbs hell bird nest spider web man friendship those bones viewer well woman alia shawkat who finds them both invitation door into friendship,5
First Cow,when cookie figowitz john magaro big short first encounters king lu orion lee brilliant young mind its moment would most films lead chase gunshots disaster bullied forlorn cook group rowdy prospectors making slow journey west cookie searching woods anything edible anything all he finds mushrooms but he also finds man naked shivering who calmly quietly asks if cook about cook about he does not scream pull gun alert his brutish traveling companions instead he offers food warmth shelter if he can manage safe passage how its managed what happens those hours mostly left imagination thats true much first cow like traveler woods who stumbles upon story youre asked fill some blanks yourself,9
First Cow,one those blanks exists between first meeting their second when fortunes both men somewhat reversed circumstances very different but offer same food warmth shelter time companionship cookie king lu begin build life side side rather than alone fishing building working affable silence reichardt shows us what both men want through small choices they make cookie arrives king lus small fragile cabin immediately sets work sweeping tidying gathering wildflowers place small bottle smaller shelf his friend encourages him gently sit down rest feel home but never tells him stop way you might tell guest simply leave dishes both seem know moment forward they pair through lee magaros simple quiet performances we watch them build cherish their new status quo,10
First Cow,but name film not frontier friendship arrival titular cow eventually shifts cookie king lu out their peaceful haven first cow also lone cow her mate calves died transit wilds oregon reichardt cinematographer christopher blauvelt film her particularly first shot though she were unicorn dragon practically glowing some sort internal magic riches which course accuratethe cows arrival home chief factor toby jones quietly excellent awakens cookie dreams biscuits cakes only possible milk thats when reichardt begins make first cow most tranquil softspoken heist movie history genre its also where first cow begins seem like ideal companion film parasite programmers get pairing asap,6
First Cow,cow alone doesnt spur cookie king lu into action she may flint steel but its promise wealth prosperity success independence thats kindling stated above deceptively simple film slowly quietly moving through oregon forest along riverbanks while carefully juggling ideas themes its quick hands chief among these ideas notion really truly secure brighter future you must wring every last drop here literally opportunities present themselves even if means risking all you already have like many americans before them life voting booth cookie king lu act interest wealthy secure future they dont yet probably never will have protecting their future rich selves rather than their present vulnerable existence second half film powered dangerous icarian words just one more while reichardt master tranquil keeps us cocooned rough but beautiful natural world she also slowly swells tension showing us again again how these two gentle friends succumb power those words,10

Da 5 Bloods,much i admire spike lees talent audacity film just didnt work me too many preposterous plot points while motivations everyone seemed were never clear whole thing just confusing,4
Da 5 Bloods,yes disjointed,6
Da 5 Bloods,theres lot really cool stuff going movie but directing writing gets way ultimately movie tries link viet nam war racism fails miserably trying fight two different wars loses lot,1
Da 5 Bloods,theres lot issues movie but they come down three issues 1 needs decide which movie its remaking basically tries combine treasure sierra madre apocalypse now three kings fails because how different three movies 2 length movie could have been told much more effectively almost half time i know its trying combine three movies but thats no excuse just taking too much time things 3 overthetop racism i know weird call but movie could have been lot more effective had toned down racism also some incidents involved contribute length movie without really adding anything,3
Da 5 Bloods,apparent lack any military knowledge part lee sheer number military gaffes such salutes ammunition well obvious callbacks movies involved keep throwing watchers out movie,2
Da 5 Bloods,had potential incredible movie especially acting incredible cinematography gorgeous but its just too long too many issues even satisfactory movie,4
Da 5 Bloods,film absolute mess starts out well 4 viet nam vets going back find their dead buddy some gold they hid what gold never properly explained but its been buried just below surface 50 years noone ever found one vets son finds when he goes take dump im not making up,1
Da 5 Bloods,thats not biggest coincidence though they found jungle group mineclearing activists they met town before setting off you know after hiking through jungle days just one them steps old mine just oh hi jungle mine clearers say they cant clear mines though,3
Da 5 Bloods,one guy gets bit snake sucks lood out then falls over loses gold just keeps walking without even picking up his rifle hardened vet 3 tours under his belt,1
Da 5 Bloods,next up one vets exgirlfriend who looks about 20 years too young have been age late 60s her daughter said vet doesnt look close 50 either he also finds her house even though he hasnt been touch he doesnt even know he has daughter but walks right up rings doorbell has dinner her,2
Da 5 Bloods,firefights some worst you have ever seen everyone terrible shot except heroes even though they all fire full auto what seems 400 round magazines one them shoots guy head first round even though he just said hes never held gun,2
Da 5 Bloods,then last 30 seconds black lives matter sequences gets tacked which sort fits but film shot spring 2019 so its obvious they just added current events message which muddles story about what vets went through their struggles current lives,1
Da 5 Bloods,end nearly everyone dead gold gets given away point you dont care cause characters have developed so little depth seem acting randomly,5
Da 5 Bloods,what disaster dont waste your time watching i thought spike lee supposed good how did get rating above 310 any platform,2
Da 5 Bloods,i so excited new spike lee movie out wanted like so badly but end day movie just bad plotline becomes advanced disney movie but more blood gore some casting choices were absolutely awful disjointed quality overall would expected amateur but not someone like spike lee i still gave 3 stars its display several mental issues veterans suffer but i wouldnt spend time watching one,2
Da 5 Bloods,no idea how ratings high they one,1
Da 5 Bloods,so many lame moments throughout movie didnt even bother cast younger versions main crew match flashbacks story,1
Da 5 Bloods,context resources had great potential make great movie but spike lee missed mark completely even great actors playing couldnt save,5
Da 5 Bloods,we wanted like forced ourselves finish 25ht movie what waste,3
Da 5 Bloods,couldve been much better movie if mr lee wasnt surrounded yes men hired better editors script writers,3
Da 5 Bloods,spike has missed boat again one so so bad i write im two hours thoroughly convinced aint getting any better poor script fact utterly empty script does no justice real bloods who lost their lives left best their lives jungles vietnam if i were meet him id ask why spike just why script again so poorly written meanders fails ever find its focus aim engendering no reason invest story nor characters therein cast members all great talents however they tragically criminally wasted here i bored my family too thirtyminute mark managed even go further down hill there utter waste time there nothing nothing redeeming about disaster throwntogether film implausible uninspired i say all i true spike lee fan please please do yourself favor avoid godawful film please life too short,1
Da 5 Bloods,perhaps i can understand same old actors playing their selves war but least 40 years vietnam passed otis has daughter less than 30 too many political overtones stereotypes i just wanted see good movie sorry,1
Da 5 Bloods,films intro best bit all went downhill there two half hours predictable plot awful unnatural dialogue cinematography jarring wrong reasons colour palette didnt match within individual scenes changing aspect ratio nice touch but i feel like after thought much framing felt off awfully wide what felt like no reason,2
Da 5 Bloods,editing rather lacklustre felt like soap opera,1
No Country for Old Men,message film there no symmetry life what goes around does not come around fall coin has no bearing way cookie crumbles there no right wrong fates men no justice opportunities seized may lead fortune but they could just well lead dusty death only children expect things fair things once were they need no longer now imdb has decided list reviews date there slightly increased possibility effort will read someone performance reviews absolutely not read me helpfulness but interest entertainment,10
No Country for Old Men,i expect film like no country old men polarizing some especially if theyre expecting big finale good guy bad guy drawing their guns end settle score no country old men film dabbles more existentialism despite all crime occurs basically what im saying film adapted novel very unconventional not only its genre but also its approach storytelling what coen brothers do best combining altogether different elements creating something its own unique character while there subtle throwbacks old wild west story takes place modern society where technology has advanced society has advanced unfortunately crime has too,10
No Country for Old Men,what anton chigurhs true motives does he have philosophical doctrine we audience unaware just unable comprehend what anton does create lot questions arise his actions his interactions other characters watch character odd him fascinating i cannot give enough credit javier bardem portraying such character so enigmatic just his presence alone able evoke so much mystery even though anton very incomprehensive all made up being able somehow captivated him,10
No Country for Old Men,how every character deals anton interesting say least film progresses feeling despondency increases gradually lack heroes what gives film its sense hopelessness feeling hopelessness basically set stone first few shots coupled tommy lee jones epic voiceover narration introducing story perfect introduction what we will witness story what all means sheriff like him comprehending these events events occur we audience reflect these situations just much sheriff ed tom bell tommy lee jones performance role impressive injected great sense humanity i commend his portrayal bell he character who carries weight story,9
No Country for Old Men,acting huge fragment bringing film life but what also does how visuals executed definitely utilized great effect its majestic shots its beautiful lighting color tones coen brothers set mood permeates whole film its barren settings really add feeling desolation same time hypnotic surreal while film can suspenseful its suspense definitely executed perfectly film still somehow manages maintain air mystique nonexistence soundtrack really gives film feeling loneliness all while adding even greater sense sterility its already barren wasteland,1
No Country for Old Men,i can go about great acting its memorable shots its great script but what makes no country great film manages truly idiosyncratic its execution just like how coen brothers other great films even if film like leaves me more questions than answers if still manages captivate me point im willing return then shows doesnt matter if i dont have any answers my questions there only few films able pull off naturally no country old men definitely one those special films can do just,10
No Country for Old Men,if doesnt end my year top two films year then we one hell awesome year movies,9
No Country for Old Men,new film two best filmmakers working today no country old men shows talents coen brothers top form after couple disappointments intolerable cruelty had flashes coen genius but felt more coen imitation than real thing ladykillers had odd funny moment but blandest film brothers ever made theres just no excusing marlon wayans they knock violent western drama out park,1
No Country for Old Men,more vein their superb early mostlyserious efforts blood simple millers crossing my personal favourite coen back catalogue no country old men slowmoving characterdriven masterpiece about uncompromising uncompromised characters very violent bloody not always squeamish,10
No Country for Old Men,shot through moments humour these come life real situations observations so dont fooled into thinking will serious film goofycharacters coens fargo no country old men tough gritty story,3
No Country for Old Men,unrelenting pace may take its time but you gripped every moment thriller genuinely thrills,8
No Country for Old Men,javier bardem gives best performance his career yes i have seen sea inside he superb but here he simply extraordinary portrayal unrelenting evil true derangement human being no shreds humanity ranks very top studied film psychopaths i say film not movie because not clichéd character not character whose lunacy you enjoy over popcorn one most frightening performances ever committed celluloid i felt truly nervous what going happen every time he walked screen,5
No Country for Old Men,josh brolin essentially carries bulk movie he excellent role challenges him i have never seen him perform level if bardem didnt steal film youd talking about brolin all way home gives him showcase his talents should see him get lot more attention,1
No Country for Old Men,tommy lee jones used sparingly but great effect sounding more like michael parks than ever before his scenes pepper movie wearied view world he doesnt really like understand great effect,1
No Country for Old Men,i did find stephen root little distracting i have never seen him serious role before he just looks amusing but he very little,9
No Country for Old Men,roger deakins cinematography breathtaking usual coens script superbly crafted there moments almost asides main plot would superfluous most scripts excised most studio films but which work perfectly overall context movie only coens can achieve one scene featuring bardem gas station up there best scenes i have ever seen film,10
No Country for Old Men,i have not gone into plot here because i saw film having not read cormac mccarthy novel knowing little other than basic logline man out hunting comes upon scene dead bodies guns drugs money mexican border comes attention both those behind scene local worldwearied sheriff i think thats way see film,1
No Country for Old Men,go knowing little you can but knowing least serious violent slowpaced character piece coens not fargo if you squeamish dont see if you have shortattention span dont see if you only love coens their fantastic comedies like o brother big lebowski comedythriller fargo dont see but if you want see intelligent superbly acted powerful beautiful cinematic treat will remind you true power cinema see see see its masterpiece bravo ethan joel,9
No Country for Old Men,while hunting trip sportsman josh brolin finds dead men stash cash remote back country west texas result drug deal gone wrong greedy hunter takes cash but soon discovers resourceful criminal responsible drug deal outlaw named anton chigurh javier bardem has way tracking loot hunter thus finds he hunted meanwhile aging texas sheriff named ed tom bell tommy lee jones after both sportsman chigurh story set early 1980s,1
No Country for Old Men,some extent film character study sheriff bell honest lawman who wise observant grounded reality has long memory no country old men really his story he doesnt know quite what make drug war has crossed over mexico into texas its something new 1980s makes land has always been hostile settlers even more hostile dangerous,1
No Country for Old Men,films premise quite simple story straightforward minimal twists lot time care taken procedural actions loading gun dressing bloody wound constructing pole retrieve package air vent example dialogue minimal theres lots silence,10
No Country for Old Men,overall casting acting impressive i especially liked performance tommy lee jones who seemed natural choice role sheriff javier bardem josh brolin also well cast several minor roles extremely well performed like store owner who asked call coin toss rotund lady who dour face defies chigurhs requests characteristic texas twang,1
No Country for Old Men,films color cinematography quite good there lots sweeping wideangle outdoor shots i really enjoyed geographic setting whistling west texas wind silence stunning vistas its landscape starkly beautiful yet despite its beauty wilderness traits can quickly turn hostile unforgiving anyone unprepared its hidden risks,1
No Country for Old Men,no country old men fine film id describe chase story character study combo elements noir especially visuals violence may tad much some viewers but given subject matter entirely appropriate,10
Grease,john travolta olivianewtonjohn lead terrific ensemble cast some critics called sets cheap story childish but moviegoing public knew better severely cleaned up broadway musical version boasts several songs customwritten onj her favorite tunesmith john farrar great personalities old 1950s include eve arden sid caesar edd byrnes frankie avalon joan blondell title opening song sung frankie vallie greasers their gals were not cleancut real life they portrayed film i remember rumbles knives but those days nobody ever brought guns school stinging parody american grandstand dick clark tops off program shanana singing their hearts out glorious black white tv graduation carnival ending really welldone yes olj sewed into her pants when she comes out greaser song youll one i want songs im sandra dee greased lightnin hand jive often edited content lyrics broadcast tv cable everything looks real me even chessy food commercials drivein some outstanding choreography dance numbers fantasy ending fun also yearbook cover doesnt match closing titles otherwise its pure joy after 40 years unsurpassed,10
Grease,how do i start i love film has great plot line incredible music fun musical makes you want get up dance,10
Grease,grease story danny zucko sandy olsen dumbruski two high school seniors who fall love over summer they have wonderful summer together sad see end first day school arrives little does danny know him sandy would soon reunited but sandy shocked find nice guy she meet beach leader greaser gang called tbirds meanwhile sandy trying fit her new friends tbirds female counterparts pink ladies will sandy danny ever together again along plot comes song will stuck your head centuries such songs include summer nights beauty school dropout now famous song greased lightining grease timeless classic will have you singing dancing end movie,9
Grease,although old grease still loved watching adults children alike once you watch grease you just want get up dance grease story badboy danny goodgirl sandy meeting each other over summer break then happen returning same school theres great mix kids they all very different have one thing separates them very much each other theres great mix songs too slow very fast also dancing amazing end also blows your mind just makes you so astonished but such good way upbeat fun never stops makes you want watch movie again again grease definite must see everyone,10
Grease,sandy danny their names alone mean nothing together they represent film we all know love brought us summer nights greased lightnin grease infamous musicalplay turned film adapted produced allan carr chartering summertastic rock n roll 1950s centring highs lows group teenagers highschool rydell high,7
Grease,film begins two people having summer romance sandy newtonjohn uptight naïve nerdy australian girl danny travolta jackthelad t bird after opening credits which amusing cartoons main characters we see two well known groups teenagers pink ladies t birds going back school after summer vacation rest film centres mostly relationship sandy danny problems they face ups downs their high school chums main characters unusual pairing sandy danny makes comfortable viewing,9
Grease,my favourite part film music film has such brilliant soundtrack if you have chance watch film dvd you get added bonus songbook however musical film you do find some parts unrealistic when they sing why would group lads sing summer nights example yet aside songs mostly corny love songs addictive easy pick up unfortunately will your head all day grease may not have had lavish budget like films made today but 1978 film directed randal kleiser still manages have great audience appeal its scenes costumes basic probably didnt break bank produce but all adds realism film,10
Grease,i like film could watch over over again newtonjohns debut performance excellent but her character sandy too 2d has no depth travoltas performance perfection film benchmarked his film career danny 3d he can loving self obsessed saviour winner whereas sandy me just bore all characters bring something different film making success rizzo hard nosed cow bitchy about sandy possibly jealous who seeks revenge her boyfriend going out his arch enemy there also marcy who loves men has lots boyfriends frenchy who becomes sandys best friend who caring,10
Grease,uplifting audience grabbing film may slightly cheesy but there just so much love about especially soundtrack dance moves gives longevity making such great film could best musical ever made classic film deserves 55 just being groovy but i just cant stop thinking why called grease,9
Grease,since i am still just teen i know many others might say i am not one criticize movie most cases i might disagree but movie what there criticize atmosphere movie charisma actors addiction awesome songs even what could have been outdated costumes instantly became halloween fave i myself dressed up new sandy when i little i still wish i could have been movie i admit sequel seemed horrible me after watching original i wished they had kept all original actors well not tried even make sequel but well movie like can only made once i suppose anyways i just want give my props admiration all directors actors others who helped movie being its member myself loving acting i think anyone who has not seen movie needs go right store find otherwise they really missed out thanks reading hope you agree,10
Grease,grease definitely has fun energy all cast has great chemistry thats main reason film despite being nearly 30 years old set 20 years earlier than still manages appeal young people today who laugh have fun course sing those timeless songs so hats off grease,8
Grease,now being said movie incredibly stupid its basically 90 minute episode happy days saved bell which we follow various plot lines high school strung together fun songs were treated such stupid dialog year i dont take no crap nobody yes maam no maam hey its eugene,10
Grease,one plot line frenchy whos memorable character but dumber than bag nails becomes beauty school drop out however aside being excuse frankie avalon sing song plot line goes nowhere she still magically graduates high school along side everyone else who knew so easy drop out get back,10
Grease,but then theres main plot line two youths named danny sandy fall love one summer which just fine real world but once back high school they realize theyre different social cliques hes greaser shes goodygoody throughout school year their relationship takes several turns before arriving absurd ending which all problems magically solved sandy getting makeover becoming cool message here so superficial its actually funny give peer pressure whatever kind person you need make your boyfriend girlfriend happy considering sandy has been celibate through all movie till now i think its implied danny will get nice surprise night message give young girls ha ha,1
Grease,so wrap up little review grease certainly has its moments wellmade movie musical else wouldnt have audience does its feelgood movie just has zero substance,10
Grease,grease 1978 john travolta olivia newtonjohn jeff conaway stockard channing dinah manoff eve arden sid caesar edd kookie byrnes shanana frankie avalon joan blondell ellen travolta eddie deezen lorenzo lamas one best broadway musicals ever adapted big screen largely thanks producer allan carr director randal kleiser set rydell high circa 1950s travolta his other iconic role leather jacket wearing hunky hood heartofgold danny zuko recalling his summer nights aussie sexpot newtonjohn her sunny sultry iconic turn goodygoody sandy who learns some things pink ladies tough yet tender leader rizzo channing ditto good old fashioned knuckleheaded comedy toetapping tunes will have you dancing singing along greased lightning imagine elvis doing dance contests hyperpaced hand jive sequence closer we go together title tune franki valli film ive seen probably hundred times never tire,10
Grease,1978s grease many eyes classic film adored all ages seemingly passes down generation generation love one first movies i remember have sense nostalgia movie plays well baby boomers because hearkens back 1950s when love swamped innocence movie got feel 1950s correct i have been told clothing background music charm acting overall look movie actual songs 1970s rocknroll style they wonderful songs tone movie upbeat fun innocent may somewhat predictable but movie itself made well,10
Grease,there variety reasons why i enjoy movie interpretation 1950s lifestyle wonderful tunes themes true loveall elevates movie into classic territory however i am irked few things though mainly age cast dont get me wrong i think performances wonderful but i despise when movies cast people their late 20s early 30s play teenagers now some films can get away but not grease you can tell people cast not teenagers check out these ages time movie release john travolta 24 olivia newtonjohn 30 stockard channing 34 but who am i complain movie gave travolta newtonjohn career boost they needed,8
Grease,story its nothing new story one has been told death but all about how story told can make break movie love story told passion thanks highspirited screenplay bronte woodard energizing direction randall kleiser musical starts off california beach 1959 complete opposite personalities have fallen love greaser danny zuko john travolta australian chick sandy olsson olivianewton john after summer romance expecting not see each other again both them attend rydell high unbeknownst each other they do their own things first danny leader gang greasers called tbirds sandy joins pink ladies led charming rizzo stockard channing when they run each other first time sandy realizes danny different man one she met beach but will stop her getting back danny well just watch movie despite my concerns ages cast i cannot deny how effective performances particular john travolta olivia newtonjohn travolta eventually became major movie star thanks movie he knows how sing dance very well actor seems like he models his character off elvis presley hairstyle black leather jacket he seems elvislite he exerts fantastic chemistry olivianewton john she also sang very well her performance new girl town excellent i liked supporting cast very much stockard channing did solid job sexhappy leader pink ladies jeff conaway dannys righthand man kenickie there some veteran cast members who did fine job particularly eve arden principal mcgee sid caesar coach calhoun,10
Grease,i most impressed grease i remember seeing little kid enjoying music but young adult resonates me because reminds me my high school days music great most these songs will stick your brain lifetime such numbers keep eye out hopelessly devoted you youre one i want former song actually went nominated oscar film all about song dance two my favorite sequences include ballroom dance scene which being filmed national television features some slick dance moves my other favorite scene ending dance sequence schools carnival very fun whole film upbeat sweet film remember,10
Scarface,every great gangster movie has undercurrents human drama dont expect emotional story guilt retribution despair scarface tale ferocious greed corruption power darker side fabled american dream,9
Scarface,anybody complaining about cheesiness film missing point superficial characters cheesy music dated fashions further fuel criticism life diabolical excess nothing lives these characters really matter not any human level least fact film practically borderlines satire ironic considering all gangsta rappers were positively inspired lifestyle tony montana,10
Scarface,isnt brian depalmas strongest directorial effort occasionally excellent wellhandled particularly memorable finale but frequently sinks sloppy misled thankfully supported very strong script oliver stone probably good therapy him considering coke habit he tackling time themes consistent focus primarily life tony montana evolution his character he consumed greed power dialogue also excellent seesawing comfortably between humour drama there many standout lines which have since wormed their way into popular culture one form another,10
Scarface,cast help make what well but really pacinos film one his earlier less subtle performances something much more common him nowadays world entirely separate michael corleone frank serpico yet he watchable here ever very entertaining intentionally overthetop form hard imagine another tony montana after seeing film possibly one most mimicked performances ever pfeiffer stood out dull uncomfortable first viewing but ive come realize how she plays out part bored little wife not exceptional effort but unfairly misjudged supporting players very good too particularly paul shenar suave alejandro sosa,10
Scarface,powerful occasionally humorous sometimes shocking continually controversial scarface one films eighties whatever might mean you essential accessible gangster flick popculture landmark 910,10
Scarface,scarface has major cult following even now 22 years after its release,10
Scarface,has also been widely criticized being very tacky unrefined overthetop all bloated up these people who compare scarface godfather movies true technical front cinematography screenplay direction etc scarface way behind godfather,10
Scarface,but also true what scarface has some other gangster movies lack rawness sheer crude approach gangsters latino gangsters movie look much more menacing real than any polished italian irish gangsters other gangster classics like godfather goodfellas one major winning points scarface i strongly believe fact has been written off tackiness most critics i have seen original 1932 scarface i must say both these movies way too different each other should seen two different movies instead praising original over remake,8
Scarface,al pacino has been criticized overthetop loud movie but how about considering precisely way filmmakers wanted tony montanas character he angry young man who takes hasty decisions throws fits tantrum every other minute he not calm michael corleone here he tony montana very tacky uneducated individual who doesnt really think much gets angry all time,9
Scarface,there definitely very 80s feel movie soundtrack all 80s i love some songs including gina elviras theme push limit title track instrumental,9
Scarface,there some memorable beautifully shot sequences including famous chainsaw scene rebenga hit first meeting sosa tonys visit his mothers,10
Scarface,about performances al pacino brilliant angry cuban refugee he has reportedly mentioned he enjoyed playing tony montana most his entire career really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly all his scenes one wonders what scarface would like without pacino i just couldnt imagine anyone else portraying tony montana all probabilities film wouldnt effective without him,10
Scarface,steven bauer shines tonys friend manny,10
Scarface,robert loggia wonderful tonys boss lopez so f murray abraham omar small role,7
Scarface,then there some eyecandy form elvira played michelle pfeiffer she looks beautiful adequate her role,8
Scarface,director does go bit overboard during particular part climax without revealing anything i would only say only little part suffers due improper handling,4
Scarface,scarface definitely one most entertaining one best gangster movies ever come out enjoy what raw portrayal drug lords their gangland,10
Scarface,scarface has great storyline brutal violence well having al pacino one his finest roles scarface one best gangster dramas,10
Scarface,classic something everybody wants have read but nobody wants read classic also something everyone praises but no one has read mark twain,2
Scarface,classic seems word used describe scarface brian depalmas 1983 film about opulence self surrender greed danger among floridas drug ring people critics rappers matter deem film epic gangster classic eptiome gangster films when anything but praised all wrong reasons scarface terrific film deserves praise all over but not all praise gets audiences today therefor fine points so poignantly makes missed general public,8
Scarface,first off film about cuban refugee past wanting escape communism grasp find happiness simple yes but layers de palmas directing genius great story written oliver stone yes i know he actually wrote real good one here play into all characters all looking escape escape natural element dealt film all each character has something offer makes them likable everyone who could appreciate film they entwined world mystique money but all has price they all learn each character thinks they getting better chances life when true dramatic irony they actually getting worse tragedy would better word describe movie all those who praise film its drug usage its violence its dialog totally missed point there nothing really positive about film besides characters positive expectations themselves why film works so well devastation through out film serves deliver message film not look cool attract viewers brian de palma doesnt make movies cult gangsters brainless action fans,10
Almost Famous,finally movie worth full price ticket almost famous cameron crowes semiautobigraphical story aspiring rock journalist who goes tour band 1970s if sounds familiar its probably because story hardly new there have been dozens movies made about rock roll lifestyle drugs sex fights all bumps road success,10
Almost Famous,so what sets almost famous apart acting one frances mcdormand brilliant williams newcomer patrick fugit wellmeaning but overbearing mother fugit his part had convincing performance shy awkward teenager struggling journalist but same time aching belong kate hudson her breakout role groupie penny lane gave her character depth beyond what might have been limiting role billy crudup band stillwaters charismatic lead guitarist shines jason lee always good stillwaters lead singer role no exception i cant review film without giving shoutout chronically criminallyunderrated philip seymour hoffman who steals every scene hes his portrayal legendary rock journalist lester bangs,10
Almost Famous,writing film also contributes its effect many great lines belong mcdormand but there plenty others go around addition music era cant beat everything simon garfunkle alvin chipmunks shows up some point movies extensive musical score,10
Almost Famous,plot may not particularly original but rings true i course am approaching review music fan someone interested industry nonetheless i believe even people who couldnt care less about rock music will enjoy movie since its not so much about music about life central theme conflict william should he remain detached but lonely outsider so impartial journalist allow himself make friends these people feel like he belongs aside bringing up questions journalistic ethics dilemma mirrors much what people all wakes life deal daily,9
Almost Famous,almost famous realistic funny touching one those rare movies makes you feel like youve gained something just having seen its too bad they say rock roll dead cause we could sure use more movies like one,9
Almost Famous,theres now wellknown scene early almost famous when william miller poring through records his older sister anita has left behind him since she ran off home inside album cover whos tommy she leaves william note telling him listen candle lit hell able see his future he puts record sparks comes look his face he listens look every rock fan will recognize,10
Almost Famous,theres been tons stuff written about rocknroll music those who think like williams mother elaine its corrupting influenceor those who go even farther consider devils music those who insist music meaningless take seriously smacks pretension because its only music then there people like cameron crowe who recognize rocknroll music which came its wake shared experience many people starting 1950s way maybe plays earlier types music were centuries before sure theres television movies well but rock music shorter more direct sure can just fun way cut loose once while but its also something which can speak what we love what we long what were afraid what we think what wounds us inside so much more,9
Almost Famous,because crowe fan hes able capture all his movie its not just obvious moments like people tour bus singing along elton johns tiny dancer which lifts them out their black mood singer jeff bebe leading everybody into singing cover rolling stone when he learns he his fellow bandmates will cover its wild spirit people like sapphire one bandaidsread groupies who follow band stillwater others they tour us more tender spirit someone like her sister bandaid penny lane who believes she other bandaids serve muse bands like stillwater who soaks all her experiences like sponge its also william who trieslike crowe did balance reporting his very obvious love music its especially line i quoted top which sapphire says stillwater guitarist russell hammond late movie sure road rocknroll isnt all covered roses theres outrageous behaviorlike how russell treats penny william losing his virginity three groupies drugs excess yes pretensionlike when jeff lectures penny about power rocknroll then adds chicks cool right but those who wanted more like spinal tap missing point isnt movie about obvious problems silliness rock music its about what still draws people though crowe acknowledges these peoples faults he still loves them who they,10
Almost Famous,course theres lot more reasons why almost famous great movie besides its love rocknroll its well acted across boardin addition all performances mentioned several times id like highlight fairuza balk sapphire not only does she get best line moviealong frances mcdormands dont take drugs rock stars have kidnapped my son line about musici also like what she other groupies yell theyre about deflower william death opie but she also captures carefree spirit time she may not important plot wise but if you took her character out movie would missing something its terrific comingofage story its bittersweet love story dialogue great looks terrific but its crowes obvious love music people who love makes almost famous best thing ive seen so far year,10
Almost Famous,ive seen few comingofage films few prodigycumgenius type films course more than my share romantic comedy stuff film skirts between lines all those possibilities somehow manages find its way viewer intact deftly whole lot oldfashioned charisma,8
Almost Famous,acting honest true how people behave without getting schmaltzy overdramatic cameron crowe gets these actors all project belief themselves bring across way we care about what happens them i particularly liked rendition william miller patrick fugit who steals show precocious rocknroll journalist he evokes visions young matthew broderick wideeyed michael j fox without ever getting corraled into being cute but troubled young kid,7
Almost Famous,frances mcdormand amazing wellcast elaine mom someone so wrapped up creating safe healthy environment she drives both her children far away home,10
Almost Famous,billy crudup kate hudson create tension filled romance drives story along both did great job were adroitly evocative those fast times rock roll fantasyland 70s billy russell hammond teeters edge fame not wanting leave his longsuffering bandmates behind but being courted bands star record company palpably torn he carries william through whirlwind emotions music along him showing him world desperate lonely even whole world seemingly vying his attention his casting also very clever seeing how billy crudup also sits brink his own stardom acclaim real life,10
Almost Famous,lester bangs williams guru played perfection phillip seymour hoffman walking oxymoron he exudes callous arrogance same time expresses genuine affection upandcomer sometimes giving william exact advice he needs get him through toughest moments rock critic dealing lovehate relationships they seem engender everyone their world music,10
Almost Famous,i cant say enough about awesome casting job well very detailed set design costuming realism times period pieces usually difficult do well mr crowe did one genuine good,10
Almost Famous,truly great film one id heartily recommend all but most jaded rock critics,10
Almost Famous,there time us rock circuit before music videos online marketing time when several littleknown bands toured all over country accompanied mostly drugs groupies writerdirector cameron crowe takes us infamous scene sex drugs rock n roll 1970s semiautobiographical work which not only equipped his brilliant direction screenplay but also decent performances some relatively lesserknown actors,10
Almost Famous,here introduction nottoofamous band imaginary one called stillwater important sense stillwater perfect work crowe volatile relationship between vocalist guitarist noncompetent manager everything comes there were also groupies who became matter substance crowes point view but most extraordinary thing crowe did image himself 15yearold writing prodigy rock journalist william miller viewers watch movie through millers eyes character extremely welldesigned reserved crowe millers one who becomes able attach all parts into complete movie alone,10
Almost Famous,billy crudup probably best among actors guitarist russell hammond its true his role not tough one but hes one who made look so easy young kate hudson penny lane perfect very adorable she showed her potentials movie which seemed even better than her mother goldie hawn all she needs decent roles future other actors namely jason lee vocalist jeff frances mcdormand williamss overprotective mother other bandaids oscarwinner anna paquin performed also quite well newcomer patrick fugit miller himself really brilliant gaining more screen time than anyone else tough test fugit all praises him,10

The Big Lebowski,my favourite coen brothers movie changes over years i watch rewatch their amazingly original consistently surprising oeuvre when i first saw big lebowski its original release i enjoyed but thought bit slight fun movie less depth than many their previous works now few years several viewing later i have come realise just how accomplished movie has become one my all time favourite movies other film makers have attempted weave together various genres styles images similarly eclectic postmodern fashion but few do seamlessly such wit ethan joel coen big lewboski extremely smart film but doesnt shout look me arent i clever sucks you get go bottom line funny comedy thats what counts most everything about movie perfect script direction set design costumes wonderful soundtrack one most brilliant ever assembled includes lesser known dylan elvis costello numbers creedence classics songs cult favourites like yma sumac captain beefheart moondog esquivel garage gods monks plus course actors who well cast virtually flawless jeff bridges fat city starman dude its impossible think anyone else acting role coen regulars john goodman steve buscemi john turturro peter stomare jon polito all board well julianne moore boogie nights david huddleston capricorn one philip seymour hoffman magnolia sam elliot mask even surprise cameos ben gazzara killing chinese bookie singer jimmie ray gilmore i cant fault big lebowski one most original entertaining comedies ever made genuine modern classic its movies like keep me watching despite endless mountain mindless garbage hollywood continually spews out if only every movie box office top ten inspired amusing one,9
The Big Lebowski,combination writing coen brothers cinematography roger deakins they created film beautiful funny coen brothers consistently impress me their ability write interesting story fascinating yet quirky characters without resorting gratuitous sexual scenes like many other writerdirectors r rated films coen brothers manage add right amount language violence necessary story without becoming only reason watching big lebowski has so many clever hilarious lines you have watch over over again,2
The Big Lebowski,nothing else needs said about other than greatest movie ever made,7
Hustlers,my primary thought im happy someone made film shines spotlight very serious problem currently becoming more common amongst sex workers sex worker myself i am exposed perspectives activities wide array sex workers daily basis i have observed increasing amount sex workers who feel validated their decisions become conartists bragging proudly about robbing their own clients while im happy starting discussed mainstream media doesnt mean its pleasant thing observe its tragic era when sex work does seem getting place where its more openly accepted we have unabashed behavior like which going make people second guess any progress we may have established thus far its heavily counterproductive overall movie mostly just made me feel frustrated sad worried future but correlation reality i couldnt get off my mind i wasnt very enveloped world film itself mostly just reminded my worries regarding industry way its pupils society will carry being effected another here out,6
Hustlers,film alone okay performances were sufficient but nothing stood out which more result writing uninteresting characters caught up uninteresting events overall plot feels like should entertaining but movie bit redundant once you get into thick youre basically watching repetitive cycle not much movement goes you kind like characters less less no real conflicting energies so kind just gets worse goes movie could have use some cutting theres not enough depth complexity validate nearly 2 hour run time unfortunately,3
Hustlers,movie did have handful very amusing moments but not enough redeem thing whole its not bad movie but its also not good movie,3
Hustlers,so i went see film because i read somewhere they were getting nominated awards now i have seen no way could i believe film nominated anything script poorly constructed poorly written acting ok but no amount acting can help poor script i heard said story empowering women well nope theres definitely none i think fundamental problem film there doesnt seem point story theyre trying tell here we have group underprivileged people struggling elements beyond their control trying make best out their situation so what do they do well they go around stabbing other people back order save themselves still if they had done class beauty some sort deserving effort then maybe there could have been story story worthy being told but we dont see any film contrary how their marketing trying spin there nothing empowering about group people remains powerless beginning end theres no robin hood these scenarios theres no justice restored truly powerful arent going affected them its just other victims who fall victims these victims their circumstances now film does go into back stories main characters perhaps trying make sense how they come slipping down ultimate path but theres just so little substance background they just come across common excuses well i struggling i needed money,1
Hustlers,if you big jennifer lopez fan who sees every movie shes movie youll want see if you like movies which majority scenes set strip clubs your kind movie if you like movies about shallow unlikable characters who spend most their time work suggestively posing dancing customers most their time away work drinking partying laughing about money theyve stolen all means go see movie otherwise dont waste your time,8
Hustlers,where part where they gave money poor,1
Hustlers,imagine movie about ring ugly men who drugged older women stole their credit cards then blackmailed them into keeping quiet but these criminals were women so its girlpower movie right oh dont call them strippers theyre exotic dancers because pretending have sex while music plays rare refined talent lets call drug dealers pharmaceutical reps too,1
Hustlers,whats sad professional critics praising skies while same opening day panning beautiful movie about friendship grief guilt goldfinch based pulitzer novel movie based newspaper article about seedy group prostitutes they just love,1
Hustlers,i dont understand reviews site movie definitely not 1 i came out cinema loving,1
Hustlers,no point during did i feel like main players were heros but neither were they villains i feel like point you were meant feel uncomfortable decisions they made its not movie about girl power its about these women reacting circumstances they were put,1
Hustlers,great thing about solely focused women their stories all men movie background pieces they there play specific role but thats all they dont particularly matter except what they add women me what girl power,1
Hustlers,friend i got free tix thought would good hate watch wasnt too boring how much lopez paying her pr team float oscar rumor she cant even act trailer trashy movie not showgirls fun make fun kinda way just trash save your time money,1
Hustlers,best part movie end end i mean credits 2 hour movie finally over so many useless scenes unanswered questions movie could been great but just missing something not sure if cast directing acting but end day dragged boring,1
Hustlers,movie wasnt worst one ive ever seen being said certainly wasnt best problem director tried too hard make actresses look sexy shied too much away character development each character ended up being shallow figure whose biggest strengths were her dance moves day age i wouldve expected something far better,3
Hustlers,only hustle critics reviews persuading audiences film worth watching very poor disjointed jlos performance ok i feel case critics feeling unable criticise post harvey weinstein female ensemble do yourself favour watch oceans 8 instead,1
Hustlers,i feel though im alternate universe reading some these positive reviews 😳 begin film boring story has zero arc dramatic conflict jlo ok but has so little work far script trying create character any depth constance wu who great crazy rich asians absolutely dreadful here seems like she never acted before 😔 i almost fell asleep but unfortunately wasnt tired enough 😫 i kept waiting point emerge but never came my wife which precluded my walking out theatre so i sat out end afterwards i felt violated i couldnt believe someone thought story worth telling dont get me wrong i think more able hands good film could made source material but ladies gentlemanaint 🤕 seriously awful anyone employing one these critics who have put positive spin garbage i sayi believe drug test definitely order,1
Hustlers,wanted leave theater entire time horrible movie beginning end,1
Hustlers,best part previews people were walking out theatre,6
Hustlers,we went movie another couple they huge jlo fans half way thru handful people walked out i wish i could have gone them but stayed our company even guys perspective move no good movie had its ups but way more downs main characters did do good job but overall they could have hacked off half hour,4
Hustlers,movie once again proof jlo should stick music nothing about entertaining characters were shallow they really hyped up beforehand make seem really exciting wasnt anyone here say her acting 1010 has her team acting has yet skill her she tries too hard,2
Hustlers,definitely not worth cost going theatre see movie dont pay money see just wait until its demand,1
Hustlers,tortuously boring pointless movie although movie less than 2 hours long felt like least 35 hours unless you going just see barely dressed jeniffer lopez do yourself favor skip,1
Hustlers,trashy movie lot t scenes were very redundant there were 3 basic scenes repeated throughtout movie 1 trashy naked girls dancing onstage 2 trashy naked girls partying wealthy businessmen while they secretly drug them take them large credit card purchases 3 scenes trashy girls shopping high end stores spending money they stole basically nutshell these 3 scenes repeated throughout movie once you see each these scenes movie over nothing more see big snoozefest if you ask me,1
My Spy,my spy new family action comedy directed peter segal director get smart tommy boy,5
My Spy,film about exmilitary jj dave bautista who after his time army now tries work cia agent during his missions he still works too much soldier cia does not get necessary information decides use jj undercover operation jj now has spy mother kate parise fitzhenley her young daughter sophie chloe coleman hope her arms trade partner contacts his family jj soon discovered clever nineyearold sophie who promises share nothing about his secret mission rest world return jj has train her how become spy herself,5
My Spy,movie has his amusing moments about how young girl can outsmart novice cia agent aspect has come up before other films such arnold schwarzenegger film kindergarden cop people familiar such films film can quickly become predictable script clearly shows bond between jj young sophie but film concentrates bit too much band time example aspect secret arms trade somewhat canceled scenes pass here seem bit like separate scenes completely different film these different aspects only come together end film but otherwise seem have little common,5
My Spy,comedy moments also somewhat predictable if you familiar these kinds comedy movies dave bautista comes across budding cia agent who doesnt yet know how best handle his job while seems bit unbelievable cia discovered nineyearold girl she manages outsmart them these moments make best comedy movie novice young actress chloe coleman does good appropriate acting film better known comedy actors such kristen schaal ken jeong still have more cameo film only have few small comic moments,5
My Spy,its pretty formulaic its pretty predictable thus not very interesting,7
My Spy,but has its moments most jokes formulaic predictable but quite few not work well i best like spoofing mission impossible its wonder people dont do more its so ripe spoofing theres not enough these good jokes make good comedy but enough make acceptable,6
My Spy,while girl isnt cute she thinks she she actually plays smart cocky girl pretty well her interaction wbautista works well her mom fits hot mom part very well she doesnt act very well though but just good enough,5
My Spy,boss pretty lame quirky nerdpartner doesnt really work its best stop exploring weaknesses they quickly pile up,10
My Spy,focusing good parts if you like such action comedies will nice comfortable experience otherwise skip,4
My Spy,my spy nothing original but still manages filled action sweet its core entertaining actioncomedy cia operative finds himself mercy 9yearold girl having been sent undercover surveil her family while weve all seen genre film before my spy stays away being family friendly movie goes more stylized action mild cursing its worth watch just see dave bautista chloe coleman together theyre cute fun coleman great night quarantine easy going flick safe bet young old follow snobmedia more reviews,6
My Spy,another wrestler big screen playing typecast action hero film plays all cliches stays safe ground keep kids watching they will weve seen all before but its watchable some funny moments plenty action but show stealer best lines me anyway his less than glamorous partner not oscar winner but very watchable what,7
My Spy,ok first all you shouldnt have high expectations when going into movie because if you do you will probably get dissapointed,4
My Spy,but lets real if you only need fun simple movie without twistet story you need stay focused then fun little movie where you can just turn your brain enjoy,8
My Spy,story fairly simple sometimes even predictable there arent any big moments you will still remember few years there no real espionage action which you might hope course you could have done more i must honest i myself expected something bit different movie beginning trailers but i like what i can enjoy charackters their interactions i can laugh lot jokes i can simply sit here enjoy simple story without need figure out what happening i think something you could need bad day,6
My Spy,so if you want fun little movie your evening after hard day you your family movie might worth shot,3
My Spy,standard feel good film its not hard work out how going go how its going end but doesnt really detract enjoyment,6
My Spy,not much action i expected but there more depth better acting than i expected well,6
My Spy,all all isnt high brow complicated oscar winning movie but decent feel good film works adults kids,10
My Spy,your typical heart warming comedydrama youve seen all before but still its ok watch film like sometimes cringe moments possibly better moments film seeing dave bautista dance highlight haha i could waste time criticism here but i dont see point film isnt terrible but its just ok times i sort knew what i going see,5
My Spy,i saw movie my 4 daughters we all loved we not professional movie reviewers anything like but absolutely enjoyed all different emotions movie charming comical witty action packed heart warming suspenseful more we also loved relationship between david batista chloe coleman just precious their performances charming there some violence language but nothing bloody disgusting,6
My Spy,bautista great comedy straight man schaal can hilarious indeed funniest scenes between those two unfortunately poor writing leaves film wanting instead jj coming across intended emotionally distant he just comes across stupid instead funny lot comedic scenes just words my 10 year old cringy awkwardness may part because movie seems distorting plot dialogue show off how woke they they cram jokes designed social commentary but they arent funny just suck any humour out mostoment news flash theres difference between coming across progressive coming across lecturing guess which side line film,6
My Spy,jj bobbi make good laugh has its moments,7
My Spy,movie little bit silly but id rather watch kind movie than discussing rated r movies uses f word every sentence cute funny,8
My Spy,useful easy time passing glancing while doing something else but even movie aware uses every cliche spy child topic create something new i find emotional stuff very poorlame i excited watch but actors scenario left not much desire,6
My Spy,nutshell massive burly spy precocious adorable 4th grader sounds like comedic match we have seen many times before movies arnold schwarzenegger dwayne johnson yet funny formula still works least did me my husband majority audience who watched press screening spy comedy last night movie isnt exactly fifty shades amazing one character says film but still super entertaining made my tired husband laugh many times thats huge compliment endorsement spy comedy we both thought cute enjoyable despite many negative reviews weve seen online,2
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,i have say no punintended into spiderverse total marvel all way down its stylish diverse styles animation its bold sophisticated storytelling visuals absolutely enchanting fast colorful distinct something sony animation always nails how each character has pronounced look movement various kinds spidermen marvel villains featured story animators went all out give them unique identity notably case spiderman noir peni parker spiderham noir whose universe takes place 1930s new york boasts dark shadowy vibe similar sin city peni parker has bubbly anime look spiderham bouncy eccentric cartoon character who takes full advantage his absurd existence deliver some films best laughs even these different identities film slows down balance their character serious nature heck one most hardhitting poignant lines spoken spiderham breakout comedic relief,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,miles majority characters share same art style i really enjoy blend 3d models traditional 2d movement its very appealing watch seamlessly matches comic book theme i also appreciate stylization certain villains kingpin character i dont think portrayed accurately outside comics just appearing generic heavyset bald brute when hes really enormous borderline nonhuman tank kingpin looks excellent film his titanic body small head intimidating grimace hes powerful force legitimately scary antagonist doc ock another example portrayed brilliant but outlandish female scientist psychotic passion villainy i didnt feel like i needed know more about her character she such fun villainess watch she really added suspense some action sequences,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,i really loved story i thought rich charm thrills granted i did notice some familiar elements done death superhero fiction animation canon alike such surprise villain reveals major character deaths were obviously seen coming i certainly wish some characters espeically miles uncle had more screentime but theres one fact overshadows these flaws me writing mature first all its sony animation product if you look companys past work some very soulless its marketing panders its audience incessant pop culture references juvenile comedy into spiderverse welcome departure passion integrity put into project writing very grounded treats its audience like people who want see genuinely captivating flick heck first third film somewhat slow nonchalant almost like arthouse film ive never had such cool yet offbeat engaged feeling while watching animated film big screen nothing forced nothing felt outofplace nothing took me out immersion tone pacing very adult even when something excessively goofy like spiderham onscreen its like marvel cinematic universe can dark distressing but lighthearted amusing theres perfect balance never sacrifices integrity just appeal niche audience wellthere aftercredits scene but quite hilarious so i let pass,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,thats most i can say without spoiling lot film i want you see absolute marvel your own eyes close into spiderverse everything i hoped would gamechanger both superhero filmmaking animation altogether sleek colorful funny emotional frenetic film skillfully balances all these elements there never moment felt forced never talks down audience its mature stylish take spiderman mythos perhaps best bigscreen spidey picture date some best animated visuals youll ever see i didnt have single issue film i dazzled moved throughout sony animation if your apology emoji movie then apology goddamn accepted massive bravo,8
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,movie worthy stan lees approval incredible animation great story great message film lives up hype honestly surpassed my expectations only reason i think there some negative reviews because you can never please everyone however vast majority viewers i believe youll find film great highly recommend seeing theaters just amazing animation style,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,theres hardly anything i would improve about film visuals concepts soundtrack characters pace humor animation all some best ive ever seen any film i worried hype would ruin me always does but not even group kids theater who wouldnt stop loudly talking could ruin me visually engaging beautiful every scene not mention incredibly unique art style honestly something other animated movies should have look up long time only real issue i can think flashing lights which really alienates any epileptic audience but even then its done so beautiful artful way,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,spiderman into spiderverse more than pleasant surprise which first risky move sony judging their recent successes,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,presentation alone easily decipherable lot love passion put into project making visual masterpiece,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,story while being mostly formulaic still does enough satisfy new returning audiences superhero genre combined visual style presentation into spiderverse almost feels fresh,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,biggest issue which more personal preference music film chooses todays hip hop music over actual musical score which understandable but still managed take me out film,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,another slightly smaller issue epilogue rather way film sets up press button save world its silly sounds,9
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,terms comedy into spiderverse does solid job but manages annoying times its usage spiderham,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,contrary spiderman into spiderverse worth watch solely its visual style presentation story just icing cake,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,final grade 810,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,updated review 4919,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,ive now watched movie 10 times since getting digital then bluray can safely say rare near perfect movie course my opinion i understand why movie isnt everyone lets break down few reasons why each these points,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,if we had list everything can done make near perfect movie movie checks every box visuals have been talked about endlessly won oscar them we know theyre great,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,story great giving us new spiderman his own skills personality he brings table script tight production executed laser precision,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,voice acting nothing short top notch easily second best thing about movie right behind glorious visuals,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,shamiek moore has quickly grown me over ten times ive watched movie his range good any veteran actor he injects so much life into miles morales he miles morales,7
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,chris pine did not phone short amount lines he had whatsoever just superb casting because he jake johnson sound pretty similar oh boy jake johnson,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,i never understood why jj had gotten so wildly popular over last several years movie i finally understand i get clicked moment he pops up movie around 20 minute mark till end jake turns one voice acting performances perhaps all time he succeeds bringing past his prime peter parker life runs gamut dramatic sincere intense but above all funny every single comedic line never fails make me laugh out loud many gags pop into my head while im working doing something else ill chuckle repeat line myself,9
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,ive always enjoyed hailee steinfeld she shines movie along all supporting cast,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,greatest thing about movie also happens its weakness me visuals second none another review title summed up perfectly most visually stunning movie ive ever seen absolutely agree while takes little time usually 1015 minutes your eyes adjust frame rate some people apparently can not adjust i can imagine how poor viewing experience would too bad really another thing since they didnt use actual motion blur but instead chose animate blurlike artifacts tricks make seem like blur having images doubled overlapped ghosting effect confuses some people into thinking theyre seeing 2 images 3d version without glasses lastly sheer intensity some rapid action sequences combined visual aesthetic pushed just beyond breaking point then dialed ever so slightly back direction team its just simply too much some people i get,10
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,far continuityplot holes things nature i think movie could actually stand about 1520 minutes longer there really arent many issues though so maybe just me being greedy more visuals,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,movie must see any music movie lover queen fan no queen fananyone who sees movie will going through rollercoaster emotions beeing queens music story behind music rami malek puts down excellent version freddie mercury but all actors play great movie my opinion best thing do ignore criticism go see yourself,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,im 75 yr old gramma saw movie her son grandson we all loved i heard queen music i worked raised my 4 children but never really knew band came my children lived queen music totally identified them especially their band performances my grandson heard queen because his father played all time we saw movie family movie about family friends loyalty typical band movie about risingtofame fallingfromfame movie about hanging together family loyal friends something we really need more today 2 15 time frame flies youre left wanting moremore more rami malek awesome freddie he his 3 costars last director music director entire crew deserve nominations see theatre has great sound where you can appreciate depth music one my most favorite movies 75 years,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,wow i feel mindblown after watching world premiere yesterday evening i am whether megahuge queen fan although i really like many their songs nor do i know how accurate storytelling but i suppose pretty accurate since both brian may roger taylor coproducers film but i found movie both intoxicating moving i have read some professional reviews i cannot comprehend their search documentary wisdom movie not documentary but entertaining story one worlds most iconic bands film delivers all aspects critics were so wrong about song bohemian rhapsody upon its release,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,brian may pinpointed interview red carpet he found casting excellent i dont remember exact word he used but he so right every major role perfectly casted all band members brilliant but i must emphasize rami maleks role freddie has oscar written all over what he does almost beyond comparison chapeau even taking role then delivering what he does even better although marginally than michael douglas behind candelabra gwilym lee brian may also bulls eye but malek really carries production his tiny shoulders like watching our beloved freddie all over again,9
Bohemian Rhapsody,many many memorable moments but live aid performance recreated one best scenes i have ever seen i have seen lots lots films chapeau directors producers whole team me delivering best film ytd 2018,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,my wife i both enjoyed immensely we queen fans attended tribute concert after freddie died,8
Bohemian Rhapsody,film extraordinary first foremost rami maleks performance physical resemblance only small part he had freddies body language down tee,9
Bohemian Rhapsody,but crowning glory vocals they absolutely mind blowing i dont know how they did im assuming its freddies voice lip sync flawless if its malek singing oscar bag,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,ive heard there some negative reviews floating around i find astonishing i hope malek gets least few nominations he should get multiple awards,5
Bohemian Rhapsody,i dont know how elaborate more than if you 35 younger you will understand after seeing movie,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,i just saw world premiere oh boy let me tell you about,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,movie might not masterpiece but my heart filled such happiness joy after watching i think its going burst sorry cheesiness freddie mercury brian may roger taylor john deacon so exquisitely portrayed i sometimes forgot wasnt them performances were so point so powerful you could feel energy burst through screen ¿have you seen famous car scene waynes world well now imagine full room doing same people couldnt help but sing along lets honest its impossible not too,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,i laughed cried sang wished i could have seen queen live band will live forever,9
Bohemian Rhapsody,movie brilliant portrayal mixed up life massive talent mercury no way meant diminish other fabulous musicians who made up wonderful band whilst freddies life death quite well documented his inner turmoil not movie opens up all see highlights actions individuals who had large influence his fragile life both good horrendously bad if only he could have been happy knowledge he had one best singing voices if not best ever fronted rock band rami malek does wonderful job portraying him so many ways has captured his mannerisms tee loved listening music imax auditorium brilliant,9
Bohemian Rhapsody,those us certain age queen especially freddie defined us sitting through movie i had goosebumps casting just works watching actors playing may deacon youd forgiven thinking someone had access time machine even kenny everett instantly recognisable i left movie strange combination elated terribly sad elated hear music watch story yet sad freddie so desperately lonely ultimately i think freddie would have approved whole thing his genius flamboyance shone through truly brilliant,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,film portraying band wild queen bohemian rhapsody plays itself safe its own good,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,bohemian rhapsody rollercoaster film times being painfully low key factually incorrect drama others redeeming itself its recreations classical queen concerts especially live aid another play safe issue films focus queens biggest songs lack focus less popular songs terms queen band film focuses itself mostly freddie mercury but still manages make his private life personal issues seem glossed over rushed thanks horrible pacing unfavourable writing speaking freddie mercury rami malek case he phenomenal other than there nothing particularly breathtaking nor there anything arousingly pitiful,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,contrary bohemian rhapsody isnt bad film does just enough entertain general audiences fans queen although doesnt properly function drama,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,final grade 510,7
Bohemian Rhapsody,rami malek will forever one my favorite actors since day ive watched mr robot i knew he will one biggest star someday freddie mercury legend everyone loves him but not everyone knows his story freddy mercury fearless but not everyone knows about his desperately lonely i dontt know how accurate storytelling but movie absolutely mind blowing brilliant such perfect tribute legend,4
Bohemian Rhapsody,im not saying movie perfect masterpiece infact movie has some issues director delayed but after i walk out theater my heart filled joy tears happiness brought so many emotions thats how you know movie fantastic darling casting brilliant bravo i cant get enough rami malek he obviously worked so hard rami malek pulls off amazing performance he just brings freddie back life i dont think you will see any better film about freddie mercury again its oppurtunity lifetime every aspects movie executed beautifully also whole cast so close perfection gwilym brian may ben roger joseph john amazing rami truly magnificent i recommend go see movie whether you fans queen not,10
Bohemian Rhapsody,wow what truly inspiring film made me feel being eccentric different ok long you you film brought so many emotions laughter sadness joy very heart warming times i forgot i wasnt actually watching guys queen they all looked so like them especially may mercury i thought rami rocked role massive respect guy would happily pay go back watch again my film 2018,4
Bohemian Rhapsody,quite simply critics wrong fitting tribute best performer band all time,5

7500,i fly a319320321 whoever consulted film did good job incorporated realism how airplane flown constant beating door also accurate wont open unless someone lets you,9
7500,real antihollywood movie gritty movie thrilling suspensful without glitz shine need embelish real life have super happy endings just solid performances what could actually happen they clearly had pilots pschologists police advise them there may holes but they were inaccurancies above my level knowledge had me enthalled better than its reviews but not everyone if you like your movies realistic andor like planes one you,8
7500,movie gives amazingly realistic look interplay exist actual hijacking scenarios slower pace grittier appearance direction than what many expect hollywood movie type could seen more fictional documentary which i expect reason shockingly low reviews seen however my opinion acting direction movie make one best its genre well worth watching,7
7500,somber film isnt very expansive about 15 characters total entire film takes place pilots cockpit but where film becomes robust through intensity terrifying scenario what i enjoyed about 🎞 didnt try create any false narratives stupid ideas most movies insert into scripts cheesy entertainment value no lead character although under immense pressure followed suit what most people put situation would do yes i would reccomend movie its not bang bang thriller fly through sunday afternoon what have you but its definitely latenight dramatic flick moves needle provoking solemn reflection its end,8
7500,overall very solid movie very simple some ways but nicely executed also accuracy aircraft elements very good movie,7
7500,such horribly gripping film pictures what minority have potentially been through superb acting throughout leaves tingle down your spine due pre ratings i expected nothing really so pleasantly surprised jgl becoming actor well ahead his times quite rightly so well done sir,9
7500,hijacking before 911 hijacking after 911 mean two very different things condoleezza rice,8
7500,anyone aware possible mishaps air travel knows 911 hijacking about worst possible scenario new director cowriter senad halilbasic have crafted 7500 which depicts painful realism overtaking german shuttle between berlin paris 85 passengers plane has heavy human load,8
7500,safety checks takeoff young first officer tobias joseph gordonlevitt mundane but nonetheless ominous because we know what film about adding forthcoming anguish flight attendant gokce aylin tezel tobiass fiancé whom he shares child its not difficult guess role she will play vicious negotiations open cockpit door,7
7500,lack creative casting islamic terrorists mostly arab vague notion using flight retribution western sins much more imaginative vollrath setting majority action cockpit creating claustrophobic dread if we were witnessing opening casket,10
7500,camera almost always tobias he flies plane captain dead struggles physically mentally terrorists levitt dexterous sympathetic character given moral choices inherent losing lives save lives also he must stop terrorists save plane because they want crash into populous area tobias has even more heavy lifting,9
7500,although action limited cockpit its thriller relies builtin tensions flight after 911 no minute dull because humanitys safety stake just dont show thriller someone who has never flown better has no notion about evil men do,9
7500,while streaming tense thriller comfort your home aware when you fly all comfort physical psychological may not arrive your baggage,8
7500,i have always felt less more key part what makes good film hollywood truly doesnt understand these days film realistic view into situation executed very well hollywood please take note how film succeeded where you fail so many times before,9
7500,one those movies you turn no expectations then sit stunned when credits roll i dont know who director but id like shake his hand,10
7500,film kept popping up my browser so decided watch glad i did had me glued screen all way through filmed entirely planes cockpit which itself different simple somewhat predictable terrorists plane plot but plenty excitement well filmed i thought think you will enjoy nothing not like,8
7500,im reviewing film based what i believe filmmakers wanted achieve making gritty claustrophobic reallife account brutal hijacking commercial airline exactly what i saw not hollywood film nor does have big budget but thats exactly why works one has look film what not what you may expecting if you look film solely point view copiolet which what film about then youll understand its not trying tell political story give you insight why people hijack planes runtime 90 minutes i never bored during entire time i felt every emotion protagonist felt i totally involved his plight no film perfect film no exception but made favourable impression me i felt need leave review little gem film definitely worth 90 minutes your life if you like these small gritty intense sorts films most negative reviews based opinions have nothing do storytelling i would bet nearly all negative reviews came people who didnt actually watch film,10
7500,im not good english usually lazy writes anything down but i want help people who loves read review first before watching anything like me recently i find nothing goods watch anymore i have seen thousand hijacking movies seriesand agreed one belongs one them just small b movie few actors involved good pace thrilling moments joseph gordon levitt alone which i admired could easily handle standalone movie but other cast not dissapointing all people complaining they seen kinda movies thousand times before yes thats correct story similar any other movies but why dont we just try give chance sit back enjoy thrilling rides im giving 1010 cause i enjoy small films franchise one does not dissappoint me all overall worth,9
7500,loved unexpected but gritty compelling ending threw me little bit still loved enjoy,8
7500,tension film creates palpable does without resorting usual hollywood cliches such over top musical cues anything vaguely dramatic claustrophobic carefully restrained cinematography no cgi plane shots every angle without dumbing things down audience also far most realistic depiction airliner cockpit any movie ive seen they clearly did their research when making sure they get things accurate possible film even sound engines takeoff exceptionally realistic without usual almost rocket launch sound effects while plane heading down runway followed absolute silence while plane cruising its quite obvious real a320 variant cockpit shows so someone sick hollywood dumbing down aviation scenes movies really stands out amount work research must have gone into incredible all all excellent film,7
7500,make no mistake very bold approach takes whole lot creativity pull off such concept maintain type tension evident throughout entire film,4
7500,plane hijacking films have been done before none better than paul greengrasss united 93 being based horrific true event made all more powerful film cant topped so whats filmmaker do change approach,10
7500,full credit director backers who took risk bring us scenariio totally new disturbing way what we cant see more horrific than what we can some best horror films used approach alien being one horror mostly offcamera we never really saw thing until end,9
Bloodshot,i dont get all hate its great action flick unrealistic yeah definitely but if i want something socialcritic i would watch other stuff,8
Bloodshot,give chance much better than everybody crying around here,8

Bloodshot,vins iron man universal soldier others have related however biggest star film wasnt vin but vfx particlephysics showcase theres decent enough scifi angle so its good film across several dimensions eiza gonzalex fresh hobbs shaw pretty hot too stick around 4th qtr thats where youll experience best actionvfx,6
Bloodshot,i just got out bloodshot,8
Bloodshot,i didnt like but i wouldnt say i hated very silly film seemingly aware least i hope how silly its pretty tame violence blood wise its pretty much all trailers which disappointing,9
Bloodshot,its full cliches its action routine effects whilst not bad not mind blowing either there isnt much humour but i have say hard hate film includes dick joke which takes 20 minutes pay off,9
Bloodshot,cast vin diesel bit bland guy pierce hamming up but eliza gonzález joy kt,10
Bloodshot,features two things i hate movies people eating noisily when theyd never really eat moment when you see back someones head vin diesel example whilst he talking but what you can see side his face clearly does not match what he saying,9
Bloodshot,there were 16 other people my screening they were mostly 20 younger spent lot time their phones someone even checking facebook during chase scene,9
Bloodshot,i really dont get low rating entertaining had really good fight scenes really good popcorn movie 8 maybe too high but someone has compensate 57 rating,10

Bloodshot,had no idea what bloodshot about other than trailer but i thoroughly enjoyed movie my husband being huge marvel comic book movie fan had never heard comic book series but he too had no complaints action sequences were great special effects were amazing i would recommend movie anyone who would like see fun action filled move,10
Bloodshot,honestly dont know why has gotten such poor reviews fun entertaining story nice origin setup great action cool characters its superhero movie delivers perfectly genre its like 810 me but gave 10 since there people giving movie 1 which clearly not honest score,10
Bloodshot,im not normally into action movies these days im over superhero genre but i dont know why people hating so much movie actually good movie i had no expectations i surprised how good i dont think deserves all low ratings hence i gave 9,8
Bloodshot,i found movie really entertaining kind super hero technology movie very entertaining creative ideas,9
Bloodshot,its pretty generictypical somewhat predictablebut really entertained me,10
Bloodshot,if your into cgi film you need watch i honestly didnt really care all cheesy cliches acting but special effects so good one,10
Bloodshot,start vin one my favourite actors he did superb job i watched thinking make into series itll blow van dammes universal soldier series out water being said there one major oops someone should have caught before movie released flour when suspended air makes major explosion tunnel scene first spark shot should have ignited flour totally vapourised everything tunnel while blowing out both ends,8
Bloodshot,not 10point movie but not 6point movie i think points given unfair movie,8
Bloodshot,pitch black meets xmen i enjoyed take wounded warriors getting xmen style upgrades i think if had better director would have been blockbuster hit guy pierce main antagonist just so happens guy played count monte cristo 2000 his character movie also responsible betrayal imprisonment protagonist i think why he chosen role movie i also noticed how there were references god jesus every time they programmed him brought him back life scene them standing room above diesel looking down him like god final time diesel rose dead one characters said jesus multiple times,10
Bloodshot,ignore bad reviews one vin diesels best films very enjoyable people complaining its not possible realistic go watch documentary not action movie great story actors smart story line too definitely worth watching especially if you like vin diesel hes great,10

Bloodshot,great movie hints other great movies influences movie endless if youre going take movies take best i live stealers wheel playing homage reservoir dogs no country old men cattle dispatch device good touch matrix like instant download helicopter manual etc brilliant could best reason sequel its action movie based comic book which has worked over ten years low meta score mystery action amazing i am waiting next one,10
Guardians of the Galaxy,i originally saw theater which great i remember laughing more than others smiling throughout has one best soundtracks numerous great lines effects impressive so vast amount easter eggs its so delightful how great humor among how lovely dancing bits i am glad james gunn helmed such precious project happy own bluray eventually i want 4k,9
Guardians of the Galaxy,guardians galaxy nothing short amazing movie if theres anything i can say its best superhero movie i have seen not only does have impressive set pieces enough action last you lifetime has emotional core you actually get care about each every single character overall movie filled all required thrills spills first class action movie also has great mixture comedic value deal seriousness,10
Guardians of the Galaxy,films unlikely hero quill chris pratt eccentric gunfighter han solo mould who we meet stealing metal orb coveted evil warlord ronan when he dispatches his top assassin green skinned gamora zoe saldana recover artifact pair find themselves locked up along galaxys most unlikely bounty hunters – guntoting raccoon bradley cooper his sidekick vin diesel who just happens walking tree all actors do great job portraying there characters they feel real beings you get know about them their struggles you become attached them every character movie got their time shine especially rocket raccoon who voiced perfectly bradley cooper everyone pitch perfect their roles even batista,9
Guardians of the Galaxy,those want specifics effects were top notch acting excellent story lines were compelling comedy perfect 995 time surprise there were lot one line typical superhero zingers worked really well what really cant stressed enough just how insanely fun entertaining guardians galaxy literally its entire twohourplus runtime i still have hard time wrestling who my favorite actor all all film brilliantly well done action scenes engrossing genuinely done you genuinely worry about certain characters i one thrilled go see,9
Guardians of the Galaxy,i remember sitting hall h comiccon two years ago when marvel first announced guardians galaxy came heels title reveals captain america winter soldier thor dark world my initial reaction one utter confusion what hell guardians galaxy i completely unfamiliar source material upon learning team featured gunwielding raccoon fighting tree creature whose could only speak single phrase i even more puzzled,10
Guardians of the Galaxy,fast forward comiccon 2013 when james gunn appeared onstage hall h showcase first trailer film so unlike anything marvel had ever done before so far outside box i immediately fell love couldnt wait see more although first trailer wellreceived comiccon audience general public seemed scratching their heads much same way i had when film first announced marvel fans would love no doubt but could bizarre little scifi romp cast unknown characters actually work,8
Guardians of the Galaxy,answer resounding yes guardians galaxy not only exceptionally wellmade comicbook film but exceptionally well made film period its sprawling space opera host memorable characters joyous scifi romp through beautifully realized worlds wildly inventive action sequences almost nonstop barrage humor fun protagonists bizarre assembly losers misfits cgcreated rocket groot providing some most emotional human moments film its all brilliant marvel should applauded allowing gunn opportunity realize his vision because rest assured film wouldnt have been nearly good someone else helm,10
Guardians of the Galaxy,guardians galaxy has distinct personality sets apart other marvel offerings yet there enough recognizable elements remind audiences exists same world clocking just under two hours film maintains impressively wellbalanced pace avoiding problem overinflation many superhero films fall victim i cant think single moment when i wasnt completely enthralled everything happens screen soon credits began roll i ready watch all over again,10
Guardians of the Galaxy,expectations surpassed they were pretty damn high begin,9
Guardians of the Galaxy,excitement met after watching teasers clips after captain america winter soldier i crossing my fingers marvel were roll,8
Guardians of the Galaxy,face still trying recover you know when you go cinema see comedy film designed make you laugh you feel like idiot paying ticket you were forcing most laughter company your friends film its genuinely easy laugh about,9
Guardians of the Galaxy,humour so subtle because characters so subtle theyre not too animated theyre not too stereotypical they not what weve come expect traditional superheroes thats why film works so well regardless if youre marvel fan simply fan movies general experience you will welcome its new refreshing scifi genre which really needed something new refreshing great performances stunning visuals barrel laughs mixed right amount action real treat watch,10
Guardians of the Galaxy,thank you marvel studios,8
Guardians of the Galaxy,i entitle my review new hope i walk out cinema feeling like i have just watched star wars our generation,10
Guardians of the Galaxy,huge marvel fan both comics film i delighted hear film getting made perfect choice guardians what perfect cast play them biggest surprise me dave bautista who i thought only cast his size but his delivery spot drax chris pratt hilarious whilst still excellent delivering some films most emotional scenes,4
Guardians of the Galaxy,cgi film super theres nothing i hate more than too much cgi film but so good guardians i completely lost never have seen space look so good battles were incredible groot rocket never looked out place aside being tree raccoon,4
Guardians of the Galaxy,gunn perfect director his tone his balance comedy action emotion blended perfectly directing gotg would have been no easy job dc still trying hard get justice league going marvel just made film talking tree raccoon awesome,5
Guardians of the Galaxy,not bad performance all round comic fans will happy certain nods winks scattered throughout probably my top marvel film yet has fresh new feeling first iron man had all action humour avengers 10 stars me even if your not comic book scifi fan movie has something everyone,1
Guardians of the Galaxy,its no surprise when marvels latest movie released many many people non comics reading kind mainly said who comic itself has never been what you call top tier various incarnations having been around decades although film based team created dan abnett andy lanning 2008 now being serviced top writer brian bendis,1
Guardians of the Galaxy,marvel certainly have made sure guardians have plenty publicity turning bunch also rans into must see event even having confidence proclaim guardians galaxy will return end movie company utmost confidence their product after seeing its very easy understand why,1
Guardians of the Galaxy,first foremost guardians fun after truly heartbreaking beginning everything goes bit daft mixing swashbuckling sci fi action larger than life characters whilst first you may little puzzled all streamlines into simple plot soon enough basically guardians leader peter quill known mainly only himself star lord has plot device other people also want plot device he forms alliance very disparate bunch people who each have their own reason helping him go into more detail really isnt necessary all will involve laying out roster names personal grievances youll get all when you watch film because if youre reading review i will lay odds youre going see,1
Guardians of the Galaxy,movie looks beautiful throughout probably thanks thousand so digital artists who take up large part end credits ship design fantastic many looking like they were pulled direct chris foss art book if you know foss youll know high compliment yeah bad guys have dull dark vessels inadequate lighting surely evil needs see well but good guys have some sexy vessels indeed sound wise may seem odd 2014 state art sci fi movie will have 1970s chart soundtrack but inclusion runaways rupert holmes course blue swedes hooked feeling completely explained rather poignant would nice too if kids start downloading some awesome old stuff finally start listening real music so speaks old fart,10
Guardians of the Galaxy,so nutshell very good movie its packed fun enjoyable characters but also has its fair share down beats dead beats top honours fought out between chris pratt excellent ridiculously likable peter quill brilliant rocket raccoon purely cgi character stuffed attitude some great one liners other main characters all do well however even big bag ronan no not boyzone one mores pity being well served very well played menace aforethought lee pace,1
Guardians of the Galaxy,one thing people want know about marvel films whats after credits scene like well without being spoilery ill say two things one its not big reveal anything like but two its really funny if you have knowledge certain old marvel character oh yeah you get play everyones favourite game movie spot stan lee just wouldnt same without him mugging up somewhere,10
Deadpool,i really really liked deadpool you know what i didnt expect seriously i never fan character sense i hardly knew anything about him humor well violence seemed forced overdone trailers still i remained interested film i just never expected actually good until reviews arrived after most critics unexpectedly showered newest superhero movie praise i went cautiously optimistic but still fully prepared hate film,8
Deadpool,first thing i noticed how inventive storytelling film throws you into action first moment literally very first moment then goes back forth brilliant unexpected ways slowly unspool story insane but oddly charming antihero flashbacks fastforwards can annoying hell but when done right they can help render even somewhat simple story fresh exciting thats exactly how deadpool felt me right start like fresh if somewhat dirty jolt energy,9
Deadpool,action itself beautifully designed employing playful visuals using pretty much every camera technique available never feels repetitive pacing close perfection but probably key me liking film so much theres beating heart underneath all action carnage has lot do how brilliantly ryan reynolds portrays character great chemistry he has costar morena baccarin what came complete surprise me how unabashedly romantic deadpool love story film probably most sincere ive ever seen superhero movie gives film strong emotional core which so many these movies lack,8
Deadpool,humor which i initially feared would just nonstop juvenile wisecracks soon become distracting also works surprisingly well not every line every joke lands but thats beauty character they dont really need deadpool cant help himself long hes able breathe hell crack wise make fun himself those around him its clinical condition hes not standup comedian whose jokes need land hes madman albeit very entertaining one comedy his case born out tragedy,9
Deadpool,despite all my praise its not perfect film villain revenge tale could more memorable story itself bit too derivative really do its highly unconventional protagonist he insists hes not hero justice but its damn good first entry franchise will hopefully explore character his world much larger extent sequels its actually very important film another reason if deadpool financial success which point already clear will could play vital role how studios henceforth view financial prospects rrated superhero films well hopefully see more them future,10
Deadpool,many people might feel different i respect their opinion but ive grown tired entirely bloodless cgi overkill all those 200 million productions where even most terrible villains talk like mormon schoolgirls i mean theres gigantic audience out there over age 18 loves read comic books can absolutely handle realworld language realworld sex realworld violence superhero movies genre so diverse its ridiculous believe just because comic books have pictures them all film adaptations regardless material must automatically made kids order successful,8
Deadpool,i think deadpool dirty funny sexy violent film which decidedly not kids just proved my point perfectly 8 stars out 10,10

Deadpool,deadpool triumph artistic vision over studio interference little credit should given 20th century fox they had zero faith success deadpool movie put things into perspective ryan reynolds fought film back 2004 when blade trinity released reynolds co went shoot test footage then leaked online reynolds because fox had no intentions release public finally after years years begging studio overwhelming positive responses test footage public fox didnt even tell reynolds co film greenlit they had find out online like rest us plebeians if sounds bad fox even cut their budget 7 million last minute which caused writers scratch some action sequences im sure wouldve been great see,1
Deadpool,deadpool now has biggest opening weekend month february surpassing fifty shades grey biggest opening weekend 20th century fox surpassing all xmen films biggest opening weekend r rated film ever surpassing matrix reloaded all being said deadpool hilariously entertaining film works mainly because reynolds himself his comedic skills pay off gloriously titular character who gives so many quips one instance some jokes will missed course credit should given writers too aka real heroes here its impressive tim millers directorial debut action sequences pacing so good youd think came veteran director,1
Deadpool,ingenious opening credits subversive ending deadpool constantly upends clichés tropes youre used seeing superhero flicks past few years whats great here filmmakers had something weird perverse just went jokes about pedophilia pegging sex run rampant but its never really dark despite mature subject matter top its also very refreshing see pansexual superhero such big studio film its unheard these days fox other studios learn success its not fact hard rrated film can do well its deadpool also happens very good most likely because you fox actually gave filmmakers creative freedom do whatever hell they wanted,3
Deadpool,if anyone else could cast play deadpool he certainly doesnt exist universe after ryan reynoldss dramatic failure green lantern film he has returned comic book world reynolds absolutely phenomenal foul mouthed witty anti hero i mean he just superb he completely owns role gives fantastic performance if robert downey jr iron man then ryan reynolds deadpool he also such liveable character end film i genuinely cared about deadpool i never thought id say all performances great no one holds candle reynolds but i will say not one person miscast here,2
Deadpool,deadpool unique film huge gamble both marvel studios bringing us film took major risk beloved character his world very different than other marvel films right off bat film consciously selfaware knows its comic book film comic book characters actually exploits many times deadpool turns audience tells us what were all thinking so different worked so very well narrative itself also different its very nonlinear events film dont play out normal straight narrative,9
Deadpool,one trademarks nay trademark deadpool his sense humour film far one most hysterical films i have seen some time writing so perfect so sharp so full witty banter thankfully all works not one joke i remember fell flat film had me laughing constantly opening credits all way after credits scene,1
Deadpool,action its also very satisfying many action films today butchered terrible camera work whatever reason many modern action films using shaky cam instead clear steady shots dp will go hand held shake camera violently worst example recent memory taken 3 thankfully there films like others know exactly how do good action scene director tim miller cinematographer ken seng do brilliant job creating slick good looking action not only action brutal extremely bloody its just co clear well handled fights really great here i couldnt help but reminded tarantinos kill bill films while watching deadpool they incredibly similar their style fight scenes,1
Deadpool,sitting cinema inner critic me struggled internally i kept thinking afterwards about film what were flaws i dont often see film without pointing out negatives even films i really like even love have flaws im certain if one sits picks apart you will eventually find some flaws perhaps overall story paper thin perhaps villain wasnt very compelling character then again ajax honestly serviceable ed skrein gave great performance end you really hate bastard hes generic dick british villain film makes fun,1
Deadpool,deadpool guardians galaxy were both huge risks ultimately paid off big time film its nearly perfect film does exactly what needed do more introduces deadpool sets up his character gets you like him if you didnt already non linear narrative refreshing see superhero film everything about film different unique its self awareness breaking fourth wall work well really well direction great ryan reynolds phenomenal script fantastic,1
Deadpool,first glance deadpool seems like typical superhero movie due being made marvel but once those hilarious intro credits show up you know you one most creative films recent years,1
Deadpool,first thing unique about film characters typical superhero films characters stiff super serious deadpool characters filled personality can range serious francis silly deadpool giving parody like feel good way,2
Deadpool,also what different story revenge rather then saving cityworlduniverse seen every single superhero film also tone film more comic then dark thanks fantastic humor all kinds slapstick dirty just plain silly film just does not stop laughs i laughed 20 30 times my second watch,1
Deadpool,being origin story i can say backstory placements were well done equally funny explains only what important understanding story final rating 1010 great nominee movie year one greatest comedies ever made,1

After,i understand i might not right audience film its more targeted towards twelve year olds have never been relationship but someone whos going twentyseven soon movie so bad so bad so many things happen dont make any sense,2
After,hardin manipulative tessas friends worst her mom just mental,5
After,please kids love god never open condom your teeth,2
After,there were parts movie were romantic left everyone cinema feeling smitten however having read books i have few bones pick,1
After,beginning quite rushed so their relationship not developed well one second they meet each other next they already lake anyone who has seen movie read book knows what happens lake all too fast me truly feel happy excited they finally getting together,1
After,movie oddly pg anyone who has read books will know books lot more passionate confusing why story about college students kept so pg when college students general arent pg they adapted very intimate nonpg book into pg movie which many who read book might disappointed i,1
After,oddly specific bone pick but i felt placement scene where they argue class over elizabeth bennet came too soon they essence arguing about tessa being interested hardin but then didnt seem like issue perhaps scene would have made more sense being after lake restaurant scene where she does confront him about whether he embarrassed seen her but what done done,3
After,lastly movie did not portray essence lovehate relationship book where hardins jealousy possessiveness where tessas attitude towards hardin they tried capture complicated nature hardins character when he tells story his drunken father his mother whilst his dads wedding but there no development i didnt see emphasis relationship issues he seemed have book also book i myself had lovehate relationship hardins character but movie i simply just enjoyed looking hero fiennestiffin considering how good looking he,4
After,all all still enjoyable movie i could tell lot hard work went into movie beautiful watch especially lake scene bathtub scene which especially cute scene i also have appreciation attention consent safe sex practices casting done well josephine langford tessa hero fiennestiffin hardin were extremely well suited their characters but i feel they could have done more their characters if they were given opportunity,1
After,romantic scenes were cute made me smile but movie lacked deeper layer book has about how complicated people can message learning love someone despite their flaws well trying better person one you love considering ana todd author after set all time i am confused why she allowed movie stray so far core messages book,1
After,small details book were included did leave smile my face when they came up they reminded me effect book initially had me but biggerpicture messages themes book seemed missing,3
After,viewers who have not read book may confused fast pace i used lot my knowledge book fill gaps,10
After,reading book does cloud my judgement so i would like emphasize still good movie which i plan rewatch many times,7
After,should you watch movie yes,7
After,do i want sequel yes i am hoping much what left out movie because they plan make sequel one which more passionate explores complicated nature hardin tessa movie did not have same effect me book did but i would still watch again tell others watch,1
After,two people meet college fall love very fast then rest movie you watch them making out plot twist isnt even twist books incredibly gripping i dont understand why they had tone plot down much movie should have been 18 feels like its 12,1
After,i went see film my hopes high since i have read books multiple times i absolutely loved them well i got really disappointed if you have read books youre going really disappointed well if you havent you will not understand story since action overall really quick so you dont really understand scenes why they even there boring because 90 film nothing much different happens most times just music playing tessa hardin kissing making out dialogues weak they barely even talk if they do just hi how you basically characters met 5 seconds later already declaring eternal love no sense all storyline poor doesnt respect film all me film killed book i feel like characters didnt show much emotion hardin i just didnt feel vibe he really superficial his personality just neutral,10
After,please go save your money go watch something better,1
After,clearly no one involved movie read books only thing they got right characters names thats completely different story than book there absolutely no chemistry between characters ive seen more passion hallmark movie seriously dont waste your money time,8
After,we died laughing cinema because so ridiculousy predictable stupid dont spend your money time i am telling you no,2
After,so i´ve read books i found them very good despite being teenage romance because complexity characters especially hardin rollercoaster storyline how you get so sucked into feel everything characters feel you can actually truly feel how tessa hardin soulmates,10
After,movie though i totally get they had cram everything together leave stuff out which most time when i have read book then watched movie annoys me but still leaved me satisfied but i too dissapointed they left out so much whole development story their love just felt extremely unrealistic strange so made all romantic scenes laughable weird i mostly rolled my eyes cringed well most theatre did soon hardin started speaking everyone room burst out laughing because how monotone he sounded how weird his lines were,10
After,they left out so much character hardin his darkness pain anger mood swings screen all tried portray just him being bit passive aggressive cry sometimes bit moody but nowhere near what could have been also made everything lose deep passion i think reason many people captured books not many romantic books capture passion way that´s what made unique me when they left all out though just became bland boring cliché film,1
After,usually when i watch romcoms whatever i am least tiny bit captivated them can least feel some compassion characters but movie didn´t move me make me feel anything all even second which sad because when i read books i cried several times,10
After,other thing i think draws people books sexual content i heard movie gonna new fifty shades grey but attempt being sexual lamest i´ve ever seen sexual scenes were so not sexual weird they were even there it´s shame becasue i feel like seuxality passion darkness hardin whole core story they left all out made into just any other love story,1

The Prestige,prestige adapted award winning novel same name christopher priest intricate tale passion intrigue deceit obsession about two illusionists whose morbid covetousness absolute supremacy their profession engenders fierce rivalry turns internecine ultimately consumes them alfred borden christian bale robert angier hugh jackman start their careers highly ambitious young men assisting elderly illusionist named milton bordens incessant longing innovation leads accidental death angiers wife borden marries sarah his apparent happiness further aggravates sense revulsion angiers heart angiers vindictive intervention during bullet catch trick causes borden lose his two fingers though these events sowed seeds implacable hatred but unremitting yearning their perpetually insatiable egos outperform each other eventually drives them perdition,8
The Prestige,angier starts performing sobriquet great danton cutter michael caine his illusion engineer while borden stage name professor fellon his engineer angier adept showman but lacks technical prowess contrary borden highly skillful but lacks taste grandeur showmanship each regards other his only obstacle owing their bitterly intertwined past starts series events which each tries stymie other any means possible sabotage abduction incrimination even killings awed apparent genuineness bordens version transported man inveigled bordens deliberate misdirection angier travels miles spends fortune approach ingenious scientist named nikola tesla david bowie order cajole him into building machine him machine could help him outperform borden nikola tesla apostle alternating current rightly thinks superior direct current under immense pressure imparted thomas edison ruthless advocator direct current his men who after tesla edisons men close him tesla runs out time hence funds his research forced oblige angier who his very last client tesla flees scene shortly after fulfilling his promise angier not without leaving him strong note caution against use his invention whose ever increasing skepticism tesla placated efficacy his masterful invention using teslas machine angier introduces his own version transported man which becomes instant success but lieu terrible selfsacrifice angier has make every night while performing story culminates viewer startled many revelations including mental physical torments bordens complex character undergoes owing his total devotion towards his art,10
The Prestige,success act illusion solely depends upon deftness which its three parts viz pledge turn prestige performed similarly movie success its three main aspects ie screenplay direction acting ought topnotch christopher nolan incredibly manages strike all right cords prestige his riveting maneuvers coupled his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize brilliance movie tenfold nolan succeeds having dream assemblage actors almost everyone giving memorable performance christian bale hugh jackman superb their lead roles michael caine shines his lowkey portrayal cutter ordinary part made appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance vintage caine david bowie nikola tesla andy serkis gollum lotr alley teslas assistant stupendous their cameos scarlet johansson also manages give scintillating portrayal bordens paramour olivia,10

The Prestige,must watch anyone who has nothing against giving his mind rigorous exercise his body adrenaline rush 1010,10
The Prestige,what prestige does very well recreate period show business history near turn century which competition between magicians serious intense workings complicated illusions gorgeously brought life via smartly detailed apparatus replicate actual mechanics victorian legerdemain,10
The Prestige,much film rings very true such allconsuming obsessions lead characters best outdo all others its easy step accept such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory rival magicians suave rupert angier riveting performance hugh jackman audacious alfred borden christian bale effortlessly playing brooding lowerclass brit each seek wreak continuing revenge upon other,9
The Prestige,story though adapted novel feels like perfect fit director nolans sensibilities machinations two men become increasingly convoluted during backandforth tug wits keeps you guessing style nolans memento game grows increasingly deadly threatens consume all they love film becomes fascinating study singlemindedness,8
The Prestige,work epic sweep beautifully filmed strongly acted only odd note casting david bowie nikola tesla he looks nothing like actual tesla if you care about these sort things his appearance calls attention itself superstar casting often does but mr bowie holds his own solid performances all around michael caine adding dignity depth old master scarlett johanssen lovely stage assistant who becomes third point twisted love triangle even andy serkis gollum memorable supporting role,10
The Prestige,introduction tesla adds yet another twist film shifts realbutpossible stage illusion steampunkish scifi transition hard note pull off since beginning film doesnt quite suggest such direction but if youre willing let nolan lead you journey into increasingly fantastic realms narrative rewards you thoughtprovoking moral dramatic exploration issues raised,10
The Prestige,truly entertaining movie original unusual dark ride well worth seeing theater its grand scope vision,9
The Prestige,prestige masterful exercise storytelling superb direction powerful performances grand ensemble cast set production design cinematography script presentation christopher nolan has once again demonstrated why he one film worlds brightest up coming directors prestige only helps solidify his standing one landmark directors his generation,8
The Prestige,told narrative jumps between various points along its time line playing out like magic act itself story two magicians rise their careers first played christian bale expert understanding fundamentals any trick but lacks showmanship second played hugh jackman master showman who more entertaining than technical tragic series events pits two performers against each other battle wits spirals further further out control consuming both them everything everyone they care about,10
The Prestige,story requires actors great deal emotive range nolan has assembled what could described dream cast both bale jackman suit their respective roles perfectly pitting these two performers against each other stroke casting genius michael caine takes what could have been forgettable role any lesser actor elevates his demanding screen presence probably most surprising performance comes david bowie whose unforgettable turn master physicist nikola tesla absolutely shines add andy serkis mix what assembled group performers who know how fully engage audience,10
The Prestige,prestige hard pigeonhole into any specific genre walks fine line between mystery drama suspense fantasy story becomes neverending stream wonder mind one can never tell exactly where story going lead next becoming more more time goes gives christopher nolan ample opportunity play play he does narration several characters each adding their own viewpoint events direction moves between time mystify distract end result climax itself series puzzles each unravel beautifully,10
The Prestige,only major criticisms can leveled prestige confusing play seasons during teslas introduction winter suddenly becomes springsummer back again strange choice music closing credits pop song end film such seems tacky however neither significant enough problem warrant any need avoid film all,10
The Prestige,end prestige fantastic display what can accomplished when you bring together superior talent certainly worth price admission good any magic show you come across,8
The Prestige,i couldnt help myself i just kept saying wow what beautifully crafted film all way home around my house when i arrived home i have not been so captured entertained long time i especially enamored screen writing how tightly beautifully visual metaphors tied writing impact human message about obsession competition retribution carried extreme,10
The Prestige,one can relate personal human struggle victory over another all costs much grander scale two magicians could easily symbolic how leaders countries come blows each other expense their women children something we struggle right now our world there deeper layers film will uncovered over time,9
The Prestige,hugh jackman christian bale sir michael caine all contributed stunning emotional performances rebecca hall who played sarah bales alfred borden turned highly charged performance well making scarlett johanssons olivia flat comparison although some people thought plot line bit tedious i found refreshingly complex engaging while not being so complex lose you if you cant follow one youve been watching television too long who cares if illusions mundane scientifically unbelievable isnt what both movies illusions ask us do suspend disbelief meantime theres message its madness hello,9

Rocketman,not movie about rock star their music simply part facts story musical truest sense uses his own music show his tribulations through eyes man during troubled years his life movie not always chronological some cases more figurative than historical way can convey sir elton johns life struggles way viewer may understand more personal level acting writing singing superb star did not try truly imitate elton but instead preforned pieces his own style he molded closely possible original sounds odd but works always you can never sum up any life book story 2 so hour movie but comes close you leave feeling like you really got know real yet flawed human elton john overall wonderful movie,9
Rocketman,rating 9010 first all when i booking ticket i dont know much who he im so excited whatching film because i want know more about him im so suprise because storyline movie really good introduce elton john me movie full emotions deep moments good acting performance taron egerton elton john matthew illesley young reggie human life too short sadoverall good film not great just good,9
Rocketman,taron egertons portrayal elton john superb only heightened producers allowing taron sing his own versions many elton johns classic hits would impossible capture all aspects elton johns life 2 hours provided musicalbiographical film so instead producerwriterdirector concentrated eltons early childhood which helped shape his destiny when he first met his partner song writing great bernie taupin played jamie bell,10
Rocketman,there were far too many other excellent performances supporting cast members mention them all but i have mention two particular who were top notch bryce dallas howard plays eltons irresponsible wife cheating mother richard madden who plays john reid one eltons early but serious lovers remained eltons manager decades after their sexual relationship ended both these actors added lot films depth one area focused eltons tormented soul lead him binge drinking pill popping which area film reflected,7
Rocketman,i hope we dont have wait elton john pass away god forbid before some producer realizes elton john bernie taupin whose lifestyles personalities so diametrically opposite they deserve their life stories developed into minimum ten 10 hour tv miniseries cover heck lot both these musical geniuss personal lives well their successes their musical portfolios,8
Rocketman,rocketman well worth seeing rates perfect 10 out 10 my version elton johns quasi autobiography book,10
Rocketman,its going get very mixed reviews i predict many will love many will revile i caught somewhere middle without giving any actual spoilers away consider,8
Rocketman,1 if you absolutely hate musicals save your money johntaupin equivalent rodgers hammerstein not presented straightforward biopic same manner bohemian rhapsody 2 much i love elton john rock roll fantasy his life treads little too far into campy territory me 2 maybe 3 very thankfully brief moments film can only described cringeworthy oh come guysseriously moments there were times when i genuinely felt going end up ken russell version tommy new millennium 3 never any point film paul buckmaster mentioned acknowledged infuriated me those who dont already know early days ejs career paul orchestrator who provided ej beautiful lush string accompaniments added so much ejs early music classic example ejs soundtrack 1971 french film friends imho could have been big player his success burgeoning artist firmly introducingestablishing elton john sound he should have been part filmeven small one if deemed necessarybut him utterly omitted story mystifies me maybe someone know can enlighten me,10
Rocketman,these 3 things however about my only problems film credit must given where its due,9
Rocketman,1 taron egerton actually pretty amazing some might see his acting occasionally over top but frankly all we know maybe ej really did act extremely times considering his anger issues his singing most time virtually spoton catching ejs lilting singing style quite well 2 supporting cast jamie bell bernie taupin bryce dallas howard richard madden ejs agent selfcentered 1st lover stephen graham dick james tate donovan las troubador club manager doug weston gemma jones ivy ejs grandmother i think friend family steven mackintosh ejs cold uncaring fatherand all others film essentially faultless especially jamies portrayal bernie wow 3 you cant really find fault staging choreography musical numbers very professionally done 4 you will learn many things about ejs life film you may not have known beforei know i did 5 have few kleenexes handy enough said 6 dont leave right away after credits roll,8
Rocketman,so worth seeing my criticisms aside we all know what they say about opinions really comes down if youre fanand especially dedicated fan like me whos followed him his humble beginnings america summer 1970go see decide yourself if my gripes hold any water,4
Rocketman,he amazing spirit fabulous elton john biopic musical jamie bell awesome usual,7
Rocketman,i want start saying i really struggle sit through longer films i get restless my attention wavers little sad i know but what when i left cinema i couldnt believe running time including adverts etc id sat through 2h30 without even thinking about time once i completely engrossed taron egerton alongwith his co stars perform excellently fantasy based musical taking you through highs lows elton johns earlier life its real rollercoaster experience i loved there were many moments which made me smile bought tear my eye different reasons ill name couple my favourites elton arrives america performs crocodile rock theres so much passion his performance then comes euphoric floating fantasy scene its so beautiful great piece cinematography which immerses you makes you feel like you there room i also loved way elton bernies friendship shown so lovely watch theres really touching scene where elton playing his piano creating music accompany lyrics your song bernie upstairs shaving yet drawn dining room listen elton bring his song life eltons singing lyrics keeps looking over bernie seemingly singing bernie platonically love song you see real bond between pair them one scene got me most after elton had tried commit suicide they showed him being rushed hospital which once he arrived there routine which he treated prepared everyone around him perform stage immediately he forces smile just showed how much he suffered how money came first really poignant again beautiful piece work theres so much more talk about such relationships between him his mumdadnew manager come lover how they were all equally cold callous scenes which elton has visions his younger self comforting younger elton end film hug all he ever wanted however wed here all day i truly adored film its definitely one watch big screen bought out so many emotions thats what i think film should do so glad ive seen have recommended everyone whos mentioned,6
Rocketman,although classical music opera more my cup teaforte has never stopped me having always admired elton john loving most his songs your song something about way you look tonight im still standing pretty much all songs lion king especially great one few exceptions being crocodile rock he iswas also quite interesting man both stage persona personal life period primarily focused very compelling one worthy being told film,1
Rocketman,rocketman not perfect film but most part thoroughly enjoyable its best dazzlingly executed when seeing cinema earlier year far films released 2019 goes rocketman me better half even if accuracy chronology can called into question still makes john his personal life detailing his childhood early career how came troubled period his career quite fascinating well being worthy lot admiration its own right,8
Rocketman,not everything works my liking last twenty minutes so executed too tidily,4
Rocketman,while john bernie taupin well rounded fully realised characters other characters despite being well acted particularly bryce dallas howard felt like underdeveloped caricatures ie parents cold behaviour towards reggie not being explained,4
Rocketman,however rocketman has so many things working its favour more so than bad first foremost taron egerton totally committed quite brilliant performance full confidence swagger flair subtlety nuance not mention great singing voice treating john respect without impersonating him scene where he opens up his mother his reaction her cold response heartbreaking particular jamie bell other performance worthy note relationship between john taupin handled beautifully right amount intensity but also taste one can tell how well they clicked feel their mutual affection really drives film times heart,1
Rocketman,looks great too beautifully photographed johns flamboyant costumes sight behold one bigger examples being unlikeanythingyouveseenbefore one therapy songs magnificent one expects staged lot brio confidence without being overblown very moving your song performance understated staging being big standout regard another powerful part being what done opening yellow brick road done so truthfully mirroring what going present moment without spelling out too much showing how much taupin cares john heck film even manages make crocodile rock tolerable one films more exuberant moments,3
Rocketman,script manages both entertaining sincere underneath all flashiness there depth too there may conventional moments story lot biopics though like but scenes showing off johns unique showmanship difficult look away story detailing johns troubled personal life time powerful great job done showing who john what he how his mind worked when dealing troubles when he writing performing dexter fletchers direction adept,1
Rocketman,summing up very very good often great film just misses out being brilliant 810,3
Rocketman,theres moment during first half hr rocketman when reggie sitting piano his robe he looks taupins lyrics composes your song his grandmother who seems only person who loved lonely child comes into living room sits down then does something so beautiful made me cry she puts her hand her chin gazes awe what her grandson has produced one gesture director shows us what genius elton john his heyday its overwhelming moment i think even taron himself may not realize just how great he movie its cliché say biopic he becomes character he portrays but taron egerton overcomes cliché he breathtaking,10
Rocketman,i have been waiting weeks premier tarons performance blowed me away i cant tell going movie about elton john going premier concert where taron singing performing telling his life story screen stage cause its premier his voice precious emotional skillful he got powerful voice yet soulful soft i am sure he right person perfect person those songs film such perfect actor gifted voice his acting outstanding his eyes told things i can felt his thoughts feelings his sadness disapointment his emptyness just breathtaking jamie bell did great richard madden also such wonderful compilation these three talented professional actors love their charisma their chemistry together thank you very much great movie really enjoyed,7
Rocketman,twice movie bohemian rhapsody had everything br lackeddrama consequences everything its not star born will forever mad bradley got screwed but its pretty close i felt lump my chest almost start movie how devastated i felt poor elton course youre going wonder how much embellishment sympathy john but same true bohemian rhapsody queen protected freddie such extent made dull movie there were some moments film i felt werent fleshed out but maybe they didnt need i cant say much without spoiling film but really fantastic being said like others have said its true musical its not biopic concert moments sprinkled if you cant handle songs speaking dialogue not film you,2
Rocketman,ive been elton john fan most my life my love music elton bernie literally shaped who i am so i really wanted love movie but i left theater irritated disappointed,10
Forrest Gump,when i first saw movie i didnt appreciate like i do now i think may have been because i so young when i first saw just recently i saw movie again what amazing story moving meaning movie teaches you so much about life meaning life isnt bad most people make seem innocent man can impact so many lives his innocence meaning movie me everyone needs have better outlook life we need appreciate more little things not let big things hold us back truly although life may throw us trials tribulations like box chocolates but we have just bite into get through even if we dont like we all need hold true our values not sink into place feels like theres no hope i just love movie anyone who hasnt seen who thinks dont like i seriously suggest seeing seeing again truly amazing,10
Forrest Gump,i believe everyone has right their opinion about films other topics however lot comments i have read about film i do not think many got gist message author film maker film great modern fable fable dictionary defined brief fictitious story teaches moral there many morals defined film but foremost integrity simple goodness,10
Forrest Gump,i have half brother who grew up southern us one occasion we were discussing film he said he felt portrayed southerners dimwitted i disagreed him informed him author himself native southerner setting central story lets tale unfold tying factual events fable before us,10
Forrest Gump,film wonderfully directed robert zemeckis film his opus acted great cast all levels children who were forrest gump gump jr haley joel osment say what you want but i feel tom hanks deserved oscar award gary sinise synonymous ltdan whenever you hear those words sally fields loving dutiful mother her challenging situation mykelti williamson bubba gives you real sense story gump had genuine friend he moves you his character words dont grasp full performance robin wright penn jenny jennys tenderness pain palpable exhibited wright,10
Forrest Gump,i feel much gumps appeal his downright sense doing right thing regardless people situations around him we see film being case maybe we all wish we could just little more like trying maintain innate goodness not tradeoffs we often make we go down lifes highways,10
Forrest Gump,movie has all toodramacomedy challenges societal norms well then there almost endless quotes movie have slipped into everyday speech they too numerous say pointone toppers me movie when forrest quandary about life wondering ltdan said we all have destiny his mom says where we all just floating around like feather wind forrests character terms very well quotei think little bit both my experiences life does appear way so if you have not seen moviesee soon you real treat if you did not like give try again hopefully you will see great story,10

Forrest Gump,im not stone cold heartless villain but takes lot make me cry when i watch movie bambis mother i couldnt care less jimmy stewart oh what wonderful life yeah right lion king when mufasa bites big one verge,10
Forrest Gump,but seriously i bawled my big brown eyes out several occasions film real tearjerker wonderful character played perfection tom hanks every bit worthy oscar rooney win premiership 2007,10
Forrest Gump,i cannot say enough film all time watch youll see,10
Forrest Gump,powerful yet charming movie fun its special effects profound how keeps you thinking long after its over like others ive seen movie more than once one comment ive never heard forrests simplicity almost zenlike i should read novel get authors intention i remember some people preferring book complaining no one academy awards gave him any credit but rather than implication you should do what youre supposed do believe god youll win end i see zenlike ie living moment not having expectations particular cravings other than his loving jenny so he ends up just stumbling into all major historical events time granted he achieves only because he doesnt have brains think otherwise actually have expectations but so many our problems because we do have higher intellect desires which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we missing we love our cats dogs same simplicity always being moment theres line movie wondering if everything predestined happens randomly its combination both something mull over long time,10
Forrest Gump,ive made about 20 films 5 them pretty goodtom hanks,10
Forrest Gump,forrest gump one best movies all time guaranteed i really just love movie has such special place my heart performances just so unforgettable never get out your head characters i mean actors turned into them thats what got me lines so memorable touching sometimes hilarious,9
Forrest Gump,we have forrest gumptom hanks not sharpest tool box his iq right below average scores but his mamasally field believes her boy has same opportunities anyone else lets forrest know theres nothing could hold him back boy he put into braces his legs since he has crooked back really doesnt have too many friends when he gets school bus his first day school no one will let him sit next them scene so heart breaking until you hear little angels voice you can sit here if you want jenny forrests best friend crush she looks so incredibly innocent you love her because her forrest like peas carrots but we find out there extremely unfortunate side her life she has father thats always kissing touching her her sisters forrest just assumes its fathers love since he doesnt have dad could show him its wrong,10
Forrest Gump,forrest jenny together walk every day school when these kids start throwing rocks forrest calling him stupid jenny just tells forrest run forrest run he miraculously breaks braces off his legs run like wind blows forrest meets many celebrities his life just happened there elvis presley visited his house before hitting big president kennedy honored him all american football award president johnson who honored him medal honor his actions vietnam president nixonin which forrest happens discover problem water gate hotel because some people seem flashing lights around john lennon through talk show talk about his medal honor,10
Forrest Gump,forrest meets some interesting people along way too even better than these celebrities combined bubba his vietnam war friend who dreams owning shrimp boat one day born big gums he just so wonderful charming wont stop talking about shrimp luteniet dan leader forrests army vietnam who gets saved forrest during huge attack looses his legs result luteniet dan far my favorite character he has so much pride wants die vietnam due his family history tradition dying every single american war he forrest make quite pair course theres jenny very tragic figure she gets more mean she grows up because she knows forrest loves her some ways you cant blame her really she obviously abused i think she felt forrest too good her he couldnt really give her love she wanted robin wright what beautiful wonderful actress,10
Forrest Gump,movie incredible should seen everyone i am not kidding forrest gump remarkable movie inspires everyone its not just about someone stupid who happens great places historic events just because being right place right time story beautiful will inspire everyone go distance see world like forrest did will never give up their dreams,10
Forrest Gump,10oct,10
Forrest Gump,i have seen movie easily half dozen times i find beauty film how forrest gump not only shares his innocence purity others including audience he also manages retain innocence purity through some very difficult times viet nam veteran college graduate late sixties i could course personally relate various periods forrest gump endures i would only mention skillful seamless blending music action period costume enthralling yet so perfectly understated forrest gumps travels through thirty five years stormiest most meaningful years american history only became clearly defined viewer even more so than well known chocolates quote metaphor life i felt remark stupid what you do probably more workable most us,10
Forrest Gump,what i find completely ridiculous why movie my opinion one best ever has such low rating so ive tried figure out what some found against iti noticed haters movie who make have lower rating than actually deserves mainly argue promotes governments politics submission idea if youre idiot but you do what youre told then you will rewarded but if you experience life then youre going die miserable death im not american myself so i dont have any intention defend government anyone else but i think political events witnessed character movie make many miss whole substance film i think these bits history only add magic film making forrest part fantastic world seems so incredibly real though,10
Forrest Gump,how can somebody say forrest just idiot ordinary person who does everything he told do appears me factin his innocence forrest does what he feels he has dono matter situations people around him lead only inner sense right so what actually seems special about forrest regardless his intelligence he has capacity discover simple truth life values all others around him miss he tries save bubba endangering his own life he gives bubbas family money mainly displays simple goodness everything he does,9

The Matrix,story reluctant christlike protagonist set against baroque mtv backdrop matrix definitive hybrid technical wizardry contextual excellence should benchmark all scifi films come,10
The Matrix,hollywood has had some problems combining form matter scifi genre there have been lot visually stunning works but nobody cared about hero nobody simply cared about anything there few though which aroused interest intellect but nobody oohed aahed special effects matrix both elements perfectly en sync not only did we want cheer heroes victory we wanted them bludgeon opposition not only did we sit awe neo evaded those bullets limborock fashion we salivated,10
The Matrix,but what makes matrix several cuts above rest films its genre there simply no loopholes script written wachowski brothers intelligent but carefully not geeky kungfu sequences were deftly shot something even bruce lee wouldve been proud photography breathtaking i bet if you had cut every frame reel had developed printed every single frame would stand its own acting maybe not best keanu reeves but name me actor who has boxoffice appeal but could portray uneasy vulnerable protagonist neo t way reeves did but come think if you pit any actor beside laurence fishburne youre bound confuse actor bad acting morpheus mr fishburne simply wicked shades his mentorrole higher learning nobody exudes aura quiet intensity than mr fishburne his character battlescarred but always composed morpheus given extra dose mortality he loves neo fault only mr fishburne can flesh out,10
The Matrix,people will say what they want say about how good matrix but bottomline finally theres philosophical film has cut through generation my generation wachowski brothers probably scribbled little ps note when they finished script saying think moment about your existence what matrix you ask something thats closer reality than you think,10
The Matrix,either its my personal choice best film alltime,10
The Matrix,may contain spoilers,10
The Matrix,there arent many movies i watched theatre twice  let alone same day but immediately after credits had rolled still pumped up rage against machine i queued up next screening matrix i so blown away film i feared probably rightly so i hadnt caught every detail what id just seen i later found out many my friends had had similar reaction film i know virtually no one who liked film didnt watch least twice its simply one those rare films so rich you just have watch them several times,10
The Matrix,structure style concept matrix groundbreaking marked first time visual style manga comic books anime such akira ghost shell had been successfully translated liveaction film apart blade runner which has totally different mood pace but also masterpiece visionary filmmaking there simply hadnt been anything even remotely like jawdropping action sequences have such raw gripping energy they feel like adrenalin overdose but unlike most action films they never overshadow story contrary they enhance make complete sense within universe,10
The Matrix,story itself i think one most original fascinating scifi tales youll likely ever see screen clearly inspired japanese anime manga yet also authors like isaac asimov philip k dick story about humanitys war against its own creation machines artificial intelligence have evolved point where they have become dominant species vastly superior their creators could take place same world blade runner terminator albeit several hundred years later but there also mythical even religious undercurrent story themes prophecy liberator even messiah make matrix transcend sciencefiction genre become even more unique,10
The Matrix,matrix watershed moment filmmaking  every respect  even though two inferior sequels have left bit stain film they cant distract what uncompromising hugely influential masterpiece scifi movies were released after matrix have tried very hard achieve similar look tone but original still owns them all 10 stars out 10,10

The Matrix,writing review matrix very hard thing me do because film means lot me therefore i want do film justice writing good review tell truth first time i saw film i enamored effects i remember thinking myself one most visually stunning films i had ever seen my life also having always been comic book fan fan films were larger than life transitional element story very appealing me probably heightened my enjoyment film very much wasnt until some time later after having seen film few times more i started think about film i recognized christian elements quite quickly but wasnt until i wrote actual 15page essay film i tapped into some philosophical religious elements made me appreciate film even more i wont say i have recognized all elements because film quite literally packed them,10
The Matrix,acting wise film works excellently i wont say there arent any issues because there but overall acting pretty flawless keanu reeves plays main character neo thomas anderson while he not perfect actor i think he does pretty good job matrix sequels he doesnt have longest lines which probably deliberate choice directors works because gives him better opportunity work posture facial expressions i must say overall his body language very good very clear well defined laurence fishbourne plays neos mentor morpheus he does excellent job his lines flow certain confidence style makes his character somewhat unique interesting carrieanne moss does good job well succeeds looking both cool sexy her leather outfit joe pantoliano critically underrated actor does brilliant job bringing his character cypher life i cant say much about him because his character pretty essential plot i certainly dont want spoil anyone gloria foster appears relatively small role will have greater significance following films she does very good job best acting provided hugo weaving however his portrayal agent smith really something watch him act out changes his character agent smith gains some human traits like anger sense dread hate eventually even sly sense humor mostly sequels two thumbs way up weaving who has created one finest screen villains all time,10
The Matrix,effects wise film simply stunning deservedly awarded oscar best effects regrettably cheated out nomination best film category ahead even star wars reason i think matrix deserves oscar best effects simply effects matrix more innovative than ones star wars just take look how many times effects have been spoofed youll probably agree effects also help symbolism film creating very dystopian atmosphere not unlike one seen blade runner works brilliantly film looks beautiful all times today 6 years later my god has already been 6 years effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films add effects brilliant editing you have visual masterpiece your hands very well done,10
The Matrix,reason i think matrix more reviewable than pretty much any other film story philosophical religious elements story because every viewing i catch something i didnt see previous time i watched without spoiling film i think i can mention few more obvious elements obviously film draws messiah myth neo clear reference jesus analogy his name neo one one but also hidden his other name thomas anderson first part his last name anderson comes greek andros meaning man combine second part his last name son add little creativity you will come up combination son man which title jesus came up about himself also first time we meet neo man calls him i quote youre my saviour man my own personal jesus christ doesnt get any more obvious than aside christianic elements film also gets its inspiration budhism gnosticism gnosis knowledge but also inspired plato his analogy cave jean baudrillards essay simulacra simulations explaining these elements would make review go forever so aside mentioning them i will not comment them further,10
The Matrix,all people who doubt profound nature matrix i can only give one advice free your mind watch film again you wont regret if i had choose favorite all time film my choice would probably fall either matrix obviously i dont expect people agree but if they do thats great lord rings return king i recommend all fans scifi people who like philosophy,10
The Matrix,1010 my top 3 best films,10
The Matrix,film well crafted matrix itself another level entirely any other science fiction film last 20 years getting lost another world interly what cinema made one takes you into whole new universe interly,9
The Matrix,without doubt one best most influential movies all time matrix defining science fiction film 1990s biggest leap genre has taken since stanley kubricks 2001 space odyssey ridley scotts blade runner matrix groundbreaking motion picture not only raised bar all sciencefiction films come after but also redefined action genre its thrilling action sequences revolutionary visual effects,9
The Matrix,film tells story thomas anderson computer hacker world hacking goes alias neo when he contacted mysterious outlaw morpheus having always questioned his reality he awakened truth world hes been living simulated reality called matrix hes nothing more than slave dystopian world created controlled ai powered machines,10
The Matrix,direction script wachowskis fantastic they drew ideas inspirations every other great scifi cyberpunk movie anime before film combining stunning action putting into one picture has enough style substance subtext everyone ended up giving their own interpretation story research went into preparation screenplay quite extensive but manner which presented big screen also very impressive every character presented film has welldefined arc purpose their motivations clear,10
The Departed,one best films 21st century departed keeps you edge your seat incredibly exhilarating characters incredibly well written given great backstory ending will shock you everything comes before some martin scorseses best work,10
The Departed,departed one rare cases when remake better than original,9
The Departed,succeeds mainly because scorseses vision ability bring project life scorsese works his cast turning dicaprio wahlberg nicholson into perfect trio turning film into best 00s like most scorseses film departed very bloody very violent but very entertaining process right opening line end credits departed shows off its style keeps consistent trough 151minute runtime however 151minute long runtime only thing preventing departed being masterpiece some moments film not many gets somewhat annoying but not annoying enough make me lose interest other words strongest point departed also weakest point departed despite being remake has enough charisma energy make seem original departed triumph its own kind works its way up hits emotional level,10
The Departed,there something everyone departed whether youre scorsese fan not but if youre familiar his work mustsee,9
The Departed,final score 910,10
The Departed,now i know departed based off hong kong movie wujiandao but scorsese really grabs hold great story brings american screen my father grew up boston when we walked out theater he couldnt stop talking about how authentic environment attitude then theres acting which lead actors nicholson dicaprio damon not only give stunningly entertaining performances but you become engulfed each ones perspective dilemmas smaller roles baldwin walberg sheen supporting roles remind me jesus quintana big lebowski i mean their screen time limited but they make lasting impressions you cherish each every scene they alec baldwin especially story itself starts off basic intro players setting but youll find yourself slowing following each every plot twist rooting back forth good guys bad guys if youre scorsese fan which i am i think you will appreciate film you can clearly see scorsese touch ranging cinematography course music its great hear gimme shelter again but comfortably numb played so well its another gangster flick scorsese yet one stands alone because feels so fresh most would agree scorsese does gangster films best so why not let him oscar worthy acting i certainly hope dicaprios best role since aviator which his best role since gangs new york am i seeing pattern here but my lasting impression wasnt concerned politics golden statue my lasting impression i had sat through 2 half hours brilliant especially entertaining storytelling thank you mr scorsese,10
The Departed,first off american stylized remake hong kong hit infernal affairs i have give credit good film i have seen both infernal affairs departed i personally prefer departed i think because one thing martin scorsese master behind such greats taxi diver raging bull goodfellas hes again film has all star cast leonardo dicaprio matt damon jack nicholson mark wahlberg martin sheen alec baldwin,8
The Departed,direction amazing maybe one reasons why he won oscar i loved how some scenes were shot set up especially regarding chinatown police interrogation scenes among many others film perfectly set up intense suspense scenes while adding amounts humor times works really well script top notch also oscar winning realistic strong dialogue scene scene,5
The Departed,another thing i liked more departed opposed infernal affairs acting dicaprio really seemed earn lot respect role here he takes tough guy persona so well sure known he good actor his oscar nominated performances whats eating gilbert grape aviator but he really takes another level here i cant see anyone else character he fits so perfectly matt damon mark wahlberg being massachusetts natives also give solid performances their natural accents nicholson works well his role well everyone extremely solid everything seemed so real,7
The Departed,set boston departed takes all boston like atmosphere beautifully shot scenes massachusetts golden dome state capital building just one part landscape dropkick murphys song im shipping up boston really fits great use songs scorsese usually works music into his films really well,7
The Departed,cops criminals when youre facing loaded gun whats difference quote really represents film matt damon plays state officer police working crime boss area frank costello nicholson while damons character can described bad guy he really misunderstood kid he sort mentored into crime business costello while costello becomes father figure damons character never had leonardo dicaprio plays young guy coming bad crime ridden family hes decides become police officer get away crime life hes been surrounded taking all into account captain queenen sheen seargent dignam wahlberg decide send dicaprios character undercover find out more about criminal underworld costello his familys crime record he fits perfectly into situation now you have highly ranked officer working bad guy undercover cop criminal underworld working state police here its all out suspenseful thrill ride whos who whos working who who can you trust paranoia threatens everyone lies betrayal sacrifice how far will you take,9
The Departed,heart film character development we really feel characters we feel like we know them its really amazing part story film tremendous story telling here,5
The Departed,one most entertaining suspenseful crimedramas i have seen while while infernal affairs came first i think departed expands so many ways really solid crimedrama check both out when you get chance its really worth 910,10
The Departed,when veteran director martin scorsese walked up collect his best director oscar 2007 his efforts hollywood remake departed felt like justice had finally been served,5
The Departed,after many miss hello goodfellas taxi driver aviator casino etc etc cinema fans breathed sigh relief when they saw longstanding master finally get his just rewards while its hard argue against fact departed unlikely scorseses best work its one his most easily accessible fun films remains joy watch day,5
The Departed,utilizing whip smart darkly humorous script scribe william monahan adapted asian megahit infernal affairs english audiences transported action asia thick drawl boston departed one most successful reimaginings all time thanks screenwriter scorseses energetic perfectly paced direction collection stars who shine together allround ensemble,9
The Departed,front centre cat mouse game sees undercover mob affiliate infiltrate boston police department while simultaneously boston police office infiltrates local mob lead trio leonardo dicaprio matt damon jack nicholson who all deliver seriously fun switched turns fantastic help likes vera farmiga mark wahlberg oscar nominated supporting turn alec baldwin ray winstone,2
The Departed,scorsese struck lucky casting his 2006 film both dicaprio damon operating peak their powers while also snaring nicholson before he fell into relative obscurity its cinematic treat see these performers eat up rich sassy dialogue play off each other great effect stories twisted ever evolving plotline transforms,4
The Departed,departed one those rarely found films continually stays move barely allowing you time stop take moments respite dicaprios undercover cop billy costigan damons undercover mob mole colin sullivan nicholsons purple adorned crime boss frank costello go about their respective lives scorseses film becoming thriller genuinely keeps you edge your seat culminating one most unforgettable times unexpected endings recalls many wide jawed reaction those caught classic cinemas myself included,1
The Departed,final say,5
The Departed,its not scorseses best film but its absolutely one his most enjoyable departed may not offer anything deep meaningful but seriously addictive thriller type cinematic ride we should all enjoy rightfully ended up becoming one most memorable films mid 2000s,7
The Departed,4 ½ rat impressions out 5,7
The Departed,please dont make negative comments like some aforementioned people have been doing if you havent seen film yet i have seen press screening last week not only best film year so far marks return form martin scorsese ranks likes goodfellas being one best his canon films,1
The Departed,im fan hong kong film infernal affairs upon which based while departed keeps basic structure original very much its own movie so much so screenwriter william monahan didnt even watch original film while adapting its screenplay thus enabling him infuse script his scorseses respective visions,7
Slender Man,movie horrible longest hr half my life kept dragging relied not so scary jump scares i impressed how much trailer made movie look scary good but course wonders cutting room floor editing plus most scenes trailer arent movie,1
Slender Man,latest version slender man mythology seems universally reviled though i dont entirely understand why its not great but its simply not bad,4
Slender Man,alike lovecraft slender man seems one those commonly used subject matters always seeems miss mark filmmakers just dont seem able make most out fantastic material presented before them,6
Slender Man,so yet again we see tale group young folks run slender man spooky things happen yadayadayada,1
Slender Man,decent young cast including joey king annalise basso were presented glossiest most high budget slender man movie yet sadly along budget comes all usual hollywood horror flaws demonstrating once again how badly hollywood have lost their way when comes entire genre,1
Slender Man,sure looks great but plot tail spins out control about halfway mark thats such shame up until then showing real potential hollywood need go back drawing board hire indie filmmakers adapt material otherwise well just keep getting insidiousconjuring tripe,3
Slender Man,slender man has its moments concept pure gold however more squandered potential,1
Slender Man,good,7
Slender Man,its slender man,8
Slender Man,atmospheric,9
Slender Man,great cast,9
Slender Man,bad,1
Slender Man,plot falls apart badly,9
Slender Man,potential isnt met,2
Slender Man,too many common tropes cliches,10
Slender Man,things i learnt movie,10
Slender Man,slender man mythology fantastic but really inconsistent no wonder they get so wrong adaptations,10
Slender Man,joey king annalise basso going big stars,9
Slender Man,slender man like aliens xenomorphs he needs keeping shadows he looks bit silly,10
Slender Man,should have been called ring slender man,10
Slender Man,slender man okay basic formula youve seen before these cheap horror movies its not scary nor bad enough enjoyable sense surprisingly some cinematography looks good theres some interesting surrealist moments but acting okay best dialogue sometimes quite cringey scares mostly just jump scares lot scenes felt same,10
Slender Man,source material hard enough work so those familiar slendys origins will find strangely adapted slender works more creepypastas video games not so much cinematically far worst horror movie made but definitely disappointing although what would you expect slender man movie coming out 2018 some will hate movie because how bland i could totally understand but more objective perspective its functional film lacks spirit,4
Slender Man,not really worth seeing,10
Slender Man,horror movie made me want sleep boring bland i thought about ring which good horror movie but movie not even good jumpscares i do not know what compare bye bye man even better version actors were not bad but not good either i feel lied trailer misleading just read creepypasta play game but do not watch movie i want my time money my vision scary slenderman back,10
Slender Man,i never thought id see horror movie worse than bye bye man,9
Django Unchained,great direction screenplay performances soundtrack cinematography costume design production design all things you can expect tarantino film,8
Django Unchained,also like others tarantino films only those who really have extensive knowledge films going really appreciate some things like franco nero scene,8
Django Unchained,quentin tarantino one most iconic directors 21st late 20th century why simple because masterpieces like tarantino defies laws film he shoots them his own way however he wants tarantino has always focused upon action thriller genre reservoir dogs up until inglourious basterds however django unchained tarantinos first look western genre his first attempt he executed beautifully scenes were shot perfectly alongside amazing soundtrack well his own small cameo,10
Django Unchained,django unchained tells story django jamie foxx slave who soon picked up bounty hunter dr king shultz christoph waltz story follows shultz takes django his deputy during their tasks bounty hunting return shultz says after winter he will help find djangos lost wife broomhilda takes them huge plantation mississippi owned calvin candie leonardo dicaprio here they plan up scheme how get away broombilda,10
Django Unchained,cast boast out amazing performances particularly christoph waltz also famous his previous collaboration tarantino inglourious bastards colonel landa both foxx dicaprios performance both equally amazing all three able add some lighthearted humour mix make sure doesnt stay too serious well having comic actor jonah hill play member kkk,10
Django Unchained,theres reason film has been nominated 5 oscars,9
Django Unchained,i only had one thought my mind christmas see django unchained quentin tarantinos latest opus western set two years before civil war concerns former slave named django jamie foxx he freed bounty hunter dr king shultz christoph waltz order help him bounty quite quickly shultz takes django under his wing trains him his partner but he made him promise he would rescue his wife plantation owned ruthless calvin candie leonardo dicaprio rescuing her not going all easy,10
Django Unchained,what pains me most about django unchained diehard tarantino fan just how sloppy all seems i enjoyed every minute but i could never shake feeling how messy thrown together all feels portions film feel episodic search brittle brothers mentioned heavily trailers begins ends practically within minutes some scenes just seem play out just fun another scene trailers involving lynch mob bags covering their faces seems added comedic purposes has no real point actually existing more than any his films before django feels like tarantino simply making movie sheer pleasure no outside motivations controllers,10
Django Unchained,film threatens go totally off rails any given moment lacks any real sense direction focus may sound ridiculous but loss editor sally menke confirms sneaking suspicion i always had about tarantino – he needed steady right hand help encourage him what needed what not i do not want criticize djangos editor fred raskin but obvious he no menke works against film heavily lacks polish we have come expect practically stripped glossycool texture so prevalent tarantinos work up until now,10
Django Unchained,but then maybe his intention all along perhaps tarantino airing out his frustrations life film general django deliberately shot film least print i saw looks very gritty messy all times significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked before borderline cartoonish kill bill included has very go broke attitude about itself film seems revel how brilliantly can splatter all blood gore done through use squibs no digital how uncomfortably numbing can make violence i know he does not care what people think his films but movie especially seems like emphatically raised middle finger establishment all my complaints about how messy all feels i never once bored felt like movie dragging itself out staggering 165minute running time shockingly flies faster than you might ever imagine,6
Django Unchained,acting wise tarantino stacks deck number recognizable character actors young old roles vary size most have very few lines if any all seem just stand just content audience watch action unfold little offputting especially how important some these characters initially made out washington broomhilda von shaft one most subtle references hes ever dropped does well helpless victim frequent dreamlike object – but she never really gets show off any her acting prowess outside her facial reactions they increasingly effective especially during horrific flashback scenes but her work here feels ridiculously stunted comparison other leads samuel l jackson much like tarantino himself seems just having fun his role candies adviser stephen he plays every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated then amps up near ludicrous state he frequently hilarious but role seems border parody more than anything else,6
Django Unchained,surprisingly foxx takes very long time settling into leading role may just character but quite clear set he not very comfortable djangos shoes leads credence why will smith amongst so many others dropped out picture so quickly but once he finds his footing he does fantastic job walking thin line between empathetic sadistic not easy character play but foxx makes his own bringing sense style grace virtually absent rest film course he gets all best lines,9
Django Unchained,waltz dicaprio clear standouts however nailing every nuance their sadly underwritten characters while waltz plays straight man dicaprio delightfully unhinged vicious both playing directly against type yet strangely comfortable roles watching them act circles around rest cast foxx included true highlight film i just wish they were both given additional emphasis more do,10
Django Unchained,all its numerous faults i had blast watching django unchained hilarious lot fun wildly enjoyable i genuinely think could have been lot better if there more focus direction but very clearly picture tarantino wanted make his own terms i applaud him effort not his best work but certainly not his worst,6
Django Unchained,810,3
Django Unchained,merry christmas all you tarantino fans out there i hope you made tarantino checklist so here we go,1
Django Unchained,witty dialogue check excessive profanity especially use word nigger check excessive violence including testicles getting blown off check soulful musical score check sometimes nonlinear narrative check shots womens feet check very great character driven plot check actual spaghetti western even though takes place american south check,4
Django Unchained,there four standout characters played top billed actors,1
Django Unchained,jamie foxx plays django freed slave who becomes bounty hunter even though he titular character he gets downplayed when presence other actors still he delivers solid performance fact hes very convincing we all know jamie foxx golden voice rnb singer comedian very clean cut image he able pull off whole transitioning timid slave menacing bounty hunter not only he had whole look down too all facial scarring messy hair,1
Django Unchained,christoph waltz plays dr king schulz german dentist turned bounty hunter who frees django so he could help pursue his previous owners who targets waltz very charismatic actor thats how he does role presents every line finesse,1
Django Unchained,leonardo dicaprio his best yet he plays plantation owner calvin candie owner djangos wife very different role weve seen leonardo gritty roles before but never did he play lecherous antagonist we were all used leo being teen idol who looked like member hanson here hes southerner discoloured teeth scruffy beard,2
Django Unchained,finally samuel l jackson who plays steve house slave who you could say secret antagonist here all screen time he has he dominates sam usually plays boisterous roles tough guy but very interesting seeing him play devious manipulative old man,2
Django Unchained,only gripe here film little too long exceeding three act structure but its epic western film so ill excuse tarantino yet again he made another great film lot flair carried well four big hitter actors well done mr tarantino,1
Django Unchained,absolutely loved every minute movie usually im not too crazy about tarantinos movies but one definitely best one ive seen long time actors were picked perfectly overall experience movie amazing when we first went watch i bit skeptical thought id end up leaving hour into movie its 3 hr movie but grabbed my attention very beginning i didnt even wanna get up go bathroom afraid miss something im usually very particular about movies nothing can hardly satisfy me but one definitely top 5 soundtrack perfect when i got home ive done some more research loved even more overall i would highly recommend film,2
Gemini Man,when i saw trailer i thought yea i already know exactly how story goes but deaging effects look nice,3
Gemini Man,so i went into expecting not much but least some average entertainment but oh boy movie kinda hard enjoy characters have no depth story totaly bland action its best moments super average,2
Gemini Man,i right both my predictions trailer already tells you whole story does feel like youve already seen before also creation young will smith totaly worked,4
Gemini Man,script horrible you can easily notice flaws there some super obvious setups so randomly thrown you know its gotta important later just then disappointed payoff even worse speaking bees,3
Gemini Man,sometimes feels like scenes missing some actually important stuff just happens offscreen,1
Gemini Man,finale disappointing unspectacular also special effects super whacky people jump run so fast looks like early 2000s movie,4
Gemini Man,conclusion will smith keeps picking mediocre movies i cant recommend you watching i really bored,2
Gemini Man,i excited see preview based off trailers looked like had such promising premise but premise wasted poor writing stilted dialogue i didnt realize written beinoff until after i saw movie but looking back makes lot sense exactly kind shlocky writing stupid characters any fan got has come expect after season 8 i can feel well x character kind forgot about y throughout plot,1
Gemini Man,idea clones very interesting itself but not film story line isnt good very predictable i did not like cgi looks like someone else wearing will smiths face not good way does not look real many action sequences look too digitalized you get out movie thinking ok thats wheres story whats point seems like both them missing,7
Gemini Man,rating 3510 three clone will smith thats all if you want go see really bad movie one you,8
Gemini Man,david benioff,5
Gemini Man,useful when adapting material not able write anything entertaining his own,8
Gemini Man,will smith will smith i like him but theres only so much one can do benioffs work,1
Gemini Man,gemini man directed ang lee stars will smith assassin who fights younger will smith,7
Gemini Man,gemini man one biggest disappointments year second disappointment year written david benioff character depth nonexistent story fails interesting often pointless action sequences mostly let downs another big problem very underdeveloped supporting characters both mary elisabeth winstead benedict wong who respectable actors given very little do serve little purpose advancing plot main reason writing no not just david benioff film has three credited screenwriters due multiple rewrites ending result mess say least,4
Gemini Man,despite poor writing i can praise gemini man great deaging effects which were easily highlight film also will smith least gives some effort his character but without any succession due poor directing,7
Gemini Man,unless you want lose close two hours your time skip gemini man go watch looper other actually good films similar concepts,8
Gemini Man,final rating 410,7
Gemini Man,dialogues painful cgi horrible writing lazy best twists extremely predictable unless youre 10 years old which only way i could imagine someone enjoying movie,6
Gemini Man,im really disappointed script awful boring dialogues paired flat characters no time i felt connected story any characters besides i also couldnt get used look movie there were many scenes had look feel soap opera,7
Gemini Man,listen you saw trailer you know what its not winning any awards maybe however they made will smith fresh prince again,7
Gemini Man,if you take campy action flick youll enjoy decent fight scenes fun motorbike chase,5
Gemini Man,if you looking high film isnt plot has few holes but most action films do,6
Gemini Man,i understand wanting come imdb get perspective film but when i steadily see low ratings movies just fun no real validity behind rating its crazy good film entertaining original perspective im also noticing anytime will smith does anything immediately haters come out wood works why his films arent great but why sway whats real reason because really not bad,1
Gemini Man,perhaps my expectations were too high but i felt whole clone subplot main theme movie wasted flick too bland absolutely nothing standing out couldve been wholly replaced,2
Fight Club,because youll probably confused first time around its not coincidence stars some greatest actors our time,10
Fight Club,would love review but we all know rule 1,8
Fight Club,end,10
Fight Club,fight club one those movies hits spot without missing inch nameless narrator edward norton insomniac office worker who lives materialistic life very beginning movie comments capitalist nature society portraiting how consumerism moves world but unable give relief end flipping through catalogues new furnite his apartment were narrators only personality trait fight against his insomnia he starts attending support groups lying people pretending he has conditions he does not have narrator finds relief emotional acceptance he finds support groups enough allow him sleep night emotional complexity character nothing unrealistic david fincher makes subtle yet clear comment nature materialist societies where no one really listens each other nor care about each other system doesnt care about anyone distance between people especially enhanced how they function capitalist world major plot point however when narrator finds someone whos faker just like him he loses his emotional escape her lie reflected my lie suddenly i felt nothing i couldnt cry so once again i couldnt sleep,10
Fight Club,shortly after tyler durden brad pitt introduced into story main character loses everything he valued deprived his possessions he seeks solace company man who polar opposite what he if narrator worker whos way too worried about his condo his job tyler freewheeling soapmaker who couldnt care less about all those things contrast between them clear tyler refuses any consumerist logic narrator whilst making he see how futile lifestyle he leading right we consumers were byproducts lifestyle obsession characters here portraid so different because one them free while other not tyler nihilistic way helps narrator realize his existence meaningless enough something clearly displayed capitalist world all they can do giving up everything selfdestruction promoted fight club ironically what allows narrator well many other frustrated men find solace their mundane life little little narrator stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job about behavior value things its interesting note narrator doesnt quit his job immediately picturing how hard actually cut ties system he eventually does though,10
Fight Club,many subtopics discussed through movie we see narrator tyler now living together talking about many things they talk about how both had absent father how both lacked sense direction life some point were told follow common sense he says get job so im 25 i call again say now what he says i dunno get married nature system we live tells us what do since moment were born while both them agree they also agree all great waste time its important notice though both them had no significant connections other people especially women tyler comments were generation men raised women im wondering if another woman really answer we need,10
Fight Club,club grows movie delves even deeper those reflections about what really matters life advertising has us chasing cars clothes working jobs we hate so we can buy st we dont need tyler becomes source inspiration everyone who attends fight club everyone much more like narrator but theyre striving more like him some point tyler decides club meant something bigger what he would call project mayhem while original fight club something kept like secret idealized give some sort freedom through selfdestruction its members project mayhem about declaring fight against system frustrated collective consciousness straw broke camels back weve all been raised television believe one day wed all millionaires movie gods rock stars but we wont were slowly learning fact were very very pied off however narrator starts slowly go against what tyler meaning do kinda recalling bit his past self sort respect authority society when happen its moment movie reaches its climax,10
Fight Club,genius movie displayed when we discover tyler durden narrator same person they have always been same person due his declining mental health his rather meaningless life he created alterego someone capable manifesting everything he wasnt system abiding person contrast created tylers different personalities amazing watch truth unfolds ambivalence created when we discover truth about tyler durden even more marvelous movie portraits very well how person can reach extremes their mind system overlooks relevance your very existence when you become just number just braindead member society having your hopes wishes constantly ignored end tyler recovers his sanity only see his actions cant reverted so he only stands watches final scene beautiful what could bettar than watching system crumbling before your eyes while where my mind plays movie masterpiece so entrancing because how real end movie shows many things we know think but tend keep hidden provocative funny thrilling most importantly so damn real plot aged perfectly i dont think going get old so soon movie must watch,10
Fight Club,fight club one most unique films i have ever seen addition presenting rather fresh take life fc also presents its material fresh way my main interest film my opinion does not present characters us think about rather presents actions us think about i will say i cannot recall ever having been asked film both suspend my disbelief way film asks its third act same time come terms understanding there no roomor needfor disbelief,10
Fight Club,perhaps these comments will not make sense average movie goer who will dismiss filmand unfortunately its premiseas another hollywood flick filled gratuitous violence id go far say film not about violence about choices about activity about lethargy about waking up realizing some point past weve gone toilet thrown up our dreams without even realizing society has stuck its fingers down our throat,10
Fight Club,i would argue anyone caught some point their lives between rock hard placeanyone who has reached bottom mental levelanyone who has uttered themselves wait isnt right i would not dosayfeel what i just didsaidfelt i do not like i must change before i am forever stuck being person i am not these people they will know what im talking about these people will not only recognize similarities between edward nortons character themselvesthey will uncomfortably familiar him these people will appreciate fight club what wake up call we not alone,10
Fight Club,david berman once said im afraid ive got more common who i than who i am becoming if sentence makes any sense you go see fight club you wont regret,10
Fight Club,l,10
Fight Club,movie one greatest all time adapted book chuck palahniuk movie has very interesting themes like emasculation violence chaos societal breakdown isolation threat death consumerism direction sublime perfect cinematography pacing editing twists nuances book captured perfectly also they did good job intercuts brad pitt edward norton were perfect choice lead movie when you watching movie you just glued your seat just how good,10
Fight Club,when i first saw previews movie had me interested movie about guys who fight didnt seem deep but i thought would provide entertainment i had heard buzz about few my friends raved about few days i convinced i should see movie i went my local video store picked up last remaining dvd i popped sat amazement until last credit rolled then watched again again again,10
Fight Club,movie dark disturbing however equally smart stylistic i found hard watch points but i couldnt turn my eyes away fight club makes many bold statements against modern consumerdriven society produces nortons best performance pitts second best 12 monkeys,9
Fight Club,norton plays averagejoe who living deadend life he needs something change his life tyler marla will take care all i want give away other comments will tell you more but i suggest you let all sink while watching its ending doesnt rival sixth sense blows away one best movie endings ive seen even better if youre pixies fan,10
Fight Club,being important dont worry you will hearing about movie when clockwork orange came out met mixed reviews deemed too dark violent now considered classic these two movies share quite bit common both were based great books if you havent read either get politicians will use movie demonstration careless consequenceless violence movies perfect example what todays youth being influenced,10
Fight Club,watch movie watch again some your more intelligent friends 10 out 10,10
Fight Club,superb truly one greatest movies all time,10
Fight Club,starts screenplay adapted very faithful excellent book book chuck palahniuk perfect movie vivid powerful challenging original unpredictable considering how perfectly formed book already screenplay would have been doddle,10
Fight Club,some very interesting themes explored consumerism class warfare multiplepersonality disorder male bonding terrorism anarchy without being judgemental,10
The Last Airbender,i would like share my sons review he just turned 8 dictated his dad typed,1
The Last Airbender,i just hate so bad,1
The Last Airbender,im huge fan cartoons i have whole series including water earth fire,1
The Last Airbender,huge disappointment because even time i saw commercial i knew would completely crushing,2
The Last Airbender,i mean characters iroh greatest disappointment he not kind wise enough also he not old enough,1
The Last Airbender,why cant they say anyones name right,1
The Last Airbender,i thought completely disrespectful put characters skin colors opposite,1
The Last Airbender,after first twenty minutes i bored already but i have say effects were decent,1
The Last Airbender,avatar did not have enough happiness him i think its important movie aang main character movie he should least get little more happiness inside him,1
The Last Airbender,when i got home night i had watch cartoon series some time completely forget about movie,1
The Last Airbender,actually im watching right now,4
The Last Airbender,if anybody wanted see movie i would suggest they close their eyes ears,1
The Last Airbender,,1
The Last Airbender,dads two cents,1
The Last Airbender,my son became interested avatar last air bender animated series age 4,1
The Last Airbender,i bought him entire series dvd soon episodes were available he i devoured every episode again again,1
The Last Airbender,compared magnificently crafted animated series id have say live action movie abysmal embarrassment sophomoric vapid display ignorance,1
The Last Airbender,go rent buy animated series instead i think its some best fiction ever written children its incredible its epic parable dealing sophisticated philosophical cultural emotional spiritual issues which have plagued human civilization since emergence reason does lightheartedness joy theme deals no less than issues greed power spirituality formation identity moral values grapples ideals pacifism teaches teamwork compassion empathy humility exemplifies wisdom appreciation art nature connectedness connectedness each other nature animals universe emphasizes detachment possession story line traverses goofy playfulness tween young teen crushes love family power dynamics friendship mental illness gut wrenching loss its incredible primer eastern spiritual ideals mythology,1
The Last Airbender,but these things cant achieved effectively without superb craftsmanship so beautifully wrought story fun action struggles adeptly punctuated moving poignancy,1
The Last Airbender,live action version none these things no insight no depth character only most cursory references some core thematic values animated series those done so poorly come off just pathetically trite,1
The Last Airbender,thing i find most upsetting regarding failure movie deliver original animated series covers all what i find best eastern culture we westerners need understand these things global community buddhist confucian ideals philosophies front center my mind greatest gifts east has offer world very things most clearly danger vanishing face wests insignificant obsession material gain conspicuous consumption,1
The Last Airbender,another thing too its typical story handled level dismissively adults appear largely disinterested profound turmoil which children engaged they enter their teens they forming their value systems they trying reconcile reality fantasy desire they trying find balance between selfishness empathy they finding what means themselves members community species planet they agony grappling issues we were happy leave behind but these struggles never truly resolved our ideas who we how we fit world cannot remain fixed yet when they challenged we adults consider ourselves state crisis when perpetual state being young teen i would argue its state flux we should never leave we should always questioning ourselves our figures authority our place world relation those around us i do not see these struggles juvenile but human animated series brings all these struggles mind sadly movie did little bring richness these struggles life,1
The Last Airbender,my most critical mood i would say failure deeply offensive my sensibilities human being,1
Black Panther,i am between 5 6 vastly overrated professional reviewers i am sure their reviews were politically motivated i loved cast but i agree characters were superficial not defined they should have been i also feel more humor needed movie cant compare other marvel movies its one shot deal us we dont need hear any more preaching,5
Black Panther,black panther popcorn movie nothing more nothing less although trys grasp idea western colonialism racism only scratches surface never really deciding were stands although has been championed one they greatest diverse films not i would recommend you check out 12 years slave get out moonlight who do much better job than meager attempt plot numbers direction nothing special chadwick bosemans acting rather stilted you can never attach his character michael b jordan one note villian who also struggles phoning performance spouting monologues about messages never really click but where movie really falls its face third act which cgi heavy looks like its out video game black panther no means terrible its below average concept wakanda excellent well excuted idea but movie just needs go little bit deeper seprate itself tired superhero formula,7
Black Panther,i went see black panther along my friends following hype train we were excited see however following showing we were all dissapointed mess movie little plot little thought which only served pit stop infinity war,3
Black Panther,critics have vastly overrated movie due its groundbreaking cast but movie itself not all groundbreaking littered all boring marvel clichés i have come know hate such their inability kill off any heros add gravitas their story one dimensional villain who only exists one movie so you know they will kill him off before next black panther also plagued new problems no one but me seemed notice example cgi awful action scenes whenever someone even prodded they would go flying across screen most outlandish fashion plot torn straight out lion king well having biggest waste martin freeman since those vodafone adverts,1
Black Panther,overall i believe my dissapointment movie fuelled marvel cinematic universe i feel sick movies they pumping out like industrial machine they all feel same little originality i can only hope bubble will burst sometime soon bring back true standalone movies which dont need cinematic universe,2
Black Panther,having attempted watch once before failed i tried again due its nod oscars thinking maybe i hadnt given fair chance,1
Black Panther,really disappointment end end bar some visuals certainly one worst marvel films ive seen i think its fair say none which were oscar worthy best picture category other categories maybe its big shame other genuine brilliant movies would have missed out their chance award due,1
Black Panther,if its taught me anything its oscars no longer relevant should ignored perhaps also many major film review sites ratings must artificial hopefully gets exposed some point would questionable ethically if not also false advertising,1
Black Panther,supposed newest best marvel movie also supposed deeper than super hero movie well basically all they did put africanamericans role main characters followed same exact formula every other marvel movie ever created action mediocre best villain good but point when he truly started flesh out his character i bored realized i watching movie i literally said what going happen about 30 minutes before happened now if you like super hero films which i happen not but if you do i am sure you will have fun enjoy film but my opinion movie had th intensity haircut boring commercial sell toys,4
Black Panther,all hype surrounding movie excellent trailers kendrickcurated soundtrack allafrican cast i thought i something special black panther while they arent remotely highest quality movies marvel cinematic universe movies generally pretty entertaining turns out i wrong black panther extremely average i have no idea what these criticsreview bots talking about when they say best marvel movie worthy critical praise not just super hero movie but movie general,2
Black Panther,things i liked,1
Black Panther,things i didnt like,1
Black Panther,overall i think probably one weaker marvel movies avoiding honest criticism because hype surrounding basic components film all pooraverage only real 510 aspect being aesthetics wakanda its people like i said above i wanted leave well before over because i knew action probably not going improve nauseating shakycam i knew how all going play out,1
Black Panther,i enjoy all other marvel movies ive seen so i expected same quite opposite i feel bored death first 25 mins probably can done less than half time i spaced out constantly when going back i realized i almost didnt miss anything so many redundant trash talk taunting declaration half way its already drained all my patience such bad one,1
Black Panther,story underwhelming best felt really boring not very creative dialects were extremely hard understandfilm actually needed english subtitles which would have been ridiculous just goes show what joke members voting films oscars i would like my 2 hours wasted back watching theater i couldnt wait movie over withits rental best should never best picture nominee,1
Black Panther,movie clearly trying present alternative classic white male superhero moviescharacters very laudable idea but implementation so bad has opposite effect furthermore focus so much racial topic some points almost racist continuous stereotypes about black people being given way if director would white person i would sue him some things movie black people acting like monkeys jokes them eating people etc sense if someone interested good movies present strong characters african background i rather recommend hidden figures pursuit happyness sic,1
Black Panther,regarding social topics movie supposed cover but thats not all,4
Black Panther,scrip rubbish after 5 minutes one can imagine exactly what going happen most dialogues such one knows next sentence before actoractress has opened hisher mouth script filled cheap emotional sentences seem taken some fortune cookie,1
Black Panther,most actors actresses movie try speak some short nigeriankenyan accent outcome ridiculous movie even managed produce ridiculous character played martin freeman,5
Black Panther,special effects movie rather disappointing specially after movies like avengers age ultron similar ones i expected least minimum marvel quality standards regarding special effects,5
Black Panther,soundtrack also rather disappointing,1
Black Panther,one good thing movie were some action scenes fighting choreographies quite good also car chases surprise pretty decent,2
Black Panther,another good point about movie if you happen watch funny group friends then you might have cheap jokes month sense too movie falls into category sharknado,1
Black Panther,watch your own risk,1
Black Panther,people made film up best marvel film all time some cgi film atrocious sound track mixed horrible concept film over all stupid,2
Zodiac,zodiac may frustrate viewers who come david finchers latest film expecting traditional serial killer thriller film begins couple hairraising rather brutal recreations murders carried out mysterious killer who terrorized san francisco bay area late 1960s early 1970s these early scenes shocking compared rest film disorienting because they offer only time we come close seeing events killers perspective film progresses zodiac killer himself fades into background movie turns into meticulous engrossing document investigation track him down investigation includes countless blind alleys false clues which day has not reached conclusion i would more prone label somewhat rambling screenplay sloppy storytelling if i did not feel fincher tells story exactly he wants elusive narrative works because film about elusive villain,9
Zodiac,jake gyllenhaal plays robert graysmith cartoonist working san francisco chronicle time zodiac killer began his gruesome work he becomes fascinated case takes sort morbid personal hobby long after police department has given up lost cause graysmith eventually wrote book which film based according his accounts he discovered enough evidence about one suspects case put police back his trail years after hed been cleared lack evidence other characters come go robert downey jr does characteristically terrific work reporter chronicle who grabs his own portion notoriety through his involvement case mark ruffalo anthony edwards play two detectives charge investigation chloe sevigny plays gyllenhaals putupon wife who gradually loses her husband his obsession all actors deliver thrilling performances many them against odds since isnt character driven movie many characters remain undeveloped but not once detriment film story isnt about people involved but rather about their role zodiac saga once theyve served their purpose fincher dispenses them ironically film clocks nearly 3 hours exhibits great deal narrative economy,8
Zodiac,parts zodiac intensely creepy fincher effectively uses rainy san francisco atmosphere its maximum potential grimy browns grays production design call mind finchers other wellknown films like seven fight club but zodiac much more grown up than those films audience enjoy has have attention span long scenes given analyzing handwriting samples recreating scenes murders digging through newspaper clippings files you can tell fincher fascinated police work precsi era when fax machines were still novel invention he delves into investigative process nearly fetishistic attention detail but he makes all endlessly mesmerizing he does his best bring everything some sort conclusion but reallife end story makes complete conclusion impossible film more about journey than destination what journey,10
Zodiac,grade,10
Zodiac,usually when film gets made about media grabbing unsolved crime resulting movie tends overtly sensational best remotely connected what really happened considering director david finchers last film about serial killer gripping but deeply disturbing se7en his take zodiac killer almost seemed primed extreme nailbiting thriller,9
Zodiac,instead what hes given us well argued thesis possible identity zodiac while there some very intense scenes fincher takes somewhat unexpected approach subject all killings take place pretty early movie bulk story centering actual investigation into killer both cops cartoonist who becomes obsessed case fact depictions murders done manner fairly reverent towards victims while still conveying cruelty them,7
Zodiac,some people may find themselves disappointed two half hour epic if they go expecting usual serial killer fare but its must see any fan finchers work anybody who likes good detective story,10
Zodiac,i have been highly interested engrossed zodiac killer story last 5 years now i can say without doubt best most accurate telling story film presents numerous details were unknown me before seeing all these facts theories thrown together way strings viewer along you think its someone then you get new information person no longer suspect fincher really puts you into life detective working case you feel just excited when new information comes about equally disappointed when leads another dead end,8
Zodiac,film beautifully shot viper digital cameras once again fincher shows us his wonderfully adept skills cgi shots all actors shine truly become their characters jake gyllenhall robert downey jr put excellent performances does mark ruffalo i also pleasantly surprised see phillip baker hall join ensemble,6
Zodiac,only complaint i have heard holds any water film too long roughly 2 12 hours i can see how many would think long but you have realize intricate story deep characters who need examined understood standard 90 minute film even two hour cut would not have been able tell story well character motivation important details would have been left cutting room floor,10
Zodiac,if you have followed zodiac case you will happy see how well done movie if you dont know anything about case you will given excellent story will make you want learn more about regardless you should do yourself favor see movie if nothing else its better than wild hogs,8
Zodiac,first up its already been saidthis film not going appeal crashbang wallopattentionspanofaboredgnat brigade out there having read lot reviews here everyone seems divided two love ithate which way will you go,8
Zodiac,yes its long but lets face not film can wrapped up hour half theres awful lot detail involved case david fincher very thorough his research full marks him excellent compelling film anyone interested true crime general detective work,10
Zodiac,i saw film few hours ago completely absorbed opening 4th july sequence worthy ticket price alone i challenge anyone listen hurdy gurdy man donovan without cold chill running down their spine after watching,8
Zodiac,main performances excellent robert downey jr jake gyllenhaal particular standout any feminists out there wont happy rather onedimensional womens roles i happen female but not what film about its about handful mens obsessive involvement one case these men utterly obsessed after so much taunting zodiac his letters cyphers who can blame them their obsession,9
Zodiac,depiction murders they quite shocking their brief brutality absolutely no glamorous excessive lingering shots aftermath makes them infinitely more real much more disturbing,4
Zodiac,combine utterly believable dialogue superb soundtrack marvellous production design you have one classy movie all those tired your average eye braincandy foddergo see those who cant appreciate class act when you see youve missed out,3
Zodiac,dark moody atmospheric all words describe candlelight dinner johnny betts but these words can also used accurately describe david finchers latest foray into serial killer genre,2
Zodiac,zodiac has been my most anticipated list quite some time but having watched many documentaries read several articles subject i couldnt help but wonder how film could completely keep my interest when i already knew so much about material plus were all aware case officially remains unresolved so we resign ourselves accept unsatisfactory conclusion,1
Zodiac,took no more than films chilling opening scene cast my fears aside glue me seat 158 minutes my familiarity source material actually heightened my enjoyment because i surprised how accurately film depicted events i recognized names details i wouldnt have otherwise,1
Zodiac,i also feel not definitively knowing zodiacs identity adds more suspense story were introduced number suspects since part one mans interpretation circumstantial evidence were allowed assume any suspects could mysterious killer its plot device effectively keeps viewer constant state unease,10
Zodiac,i know there multiple theories zodiacs identity so you can argue film ends anticlimactic note but movie does have focus presents compelling case against one suspects such way delivers much closure you can expect,1
Zodiac,actors great especially downey his welcome comic relief atmosphere foreboding investigative process engaging may run little long some but i didnt mind runtime all its fascinating case i wanted all information movie willing give me,1
Zodiac,zodiac kind film sticks you i friends house late after screening when i arrived home i saw lone cars headlights appear up street my heart began race little i hastened my door i knew then there new zodiac killer vicinity i had no time tarry,8
Zodiac,its been while since movie instilled sort realistic dread i dont know if thats good thing but its certainly sign no pun intended films success heightening our awareness what kind reallife monsters might lurking shadows,7
Hereditary,when i saw movie first time my reaction end same whole audiences wtf i mainly disappointed felt like i wasting time money movie left scars behind i couldnt stay alone home being scarred many days which kind good sign i hardly get scarred watching horror movies nowadays i am nearly 47 grew up all horror classics ive seen them all said i super angry having watched movie yesterday i went cinema my 20 year old son he wanted see movie me loving father i agreed time i figured out what truly going movie,10
Hereditary,caution spoiler dear grandmom satanist i knew first time joanne her girlfriend well i also got one but what electric impulse which you could see i figured out second time paimon demon haunting son annie but paimon needed son dead first able enter his body good which happenes just end movie when peter jumpes out window you can see peter lying ground front house when electric impulse comes enters peters body paimon now paimon has entered peters body finally summoning successful finally peter now paimon makes strange sound his tongue just like charlie did before why charlie host paimon before but her body not healthy girls body not body man which paimon needed thats why charlies grandmother wanted her boy instead being girl makes sense now btw paimon real figure well sign used film one 72 demons grimoire some magic book also used people like aleister crowley knowing film has now become real masterpiece tension increases constantly till showdown end when movie suddenly becomes one most fearing horror movies i have ever seen well done a24 ari aster great acting cast well,10
Hereditary,i mean best way possible spectrum emotions you go through range sheer terror complete hopelessness sorrow movie picks human psyche all right ways its both hard watch impossible look away hands down best horror films ive ever seen perhaps one best films general,9
Hereditary,many ways hereditary horror movie ive been restlessly waiting see so many years despite my avid fandom genre i really feel modern horror has lost its grasp how make film thats truly unsettling way great classic horror films modern widerelease horror film often nothing more than conveyor belt jump scares strung together derivative story which exists purely vehicle deliver those jump scares theyre more carnival rides than they films audiences have been conditioned view judge them through lens modern horror fan goes their local theater parts their money expectation their selected horror film will deliver goods so speak startle them sufficient number times scaling appropriately films runtime course give them money shots blood gore graphic murders welllit upclose views applicable cgi monster etc if horror movie fails deliver those goods its scoffed falls into worst film ive ever seen category i put quotes because disgruntled filmgoer behind me broadcasted those exact words across theater credits film rolled he really wanted us know his thoughts,6
Hereditary,like similarly fantastic crowddispleasing horror films past few years witch comes night hereditary film largely deals atmosphere emotional horror shining which happens my favorite horror film clear touchstone i would go far saying first modern horror film ive seen genuinely captures similar tone ethos much like film delivers its horror through intensifying sense unease dread becomes nearly suffocating its conclusion rather than startling you cheap scares offers haunting upsetting images which often delivered without any those overused sonic jolts perhaps most importantly anchors everything emotional core nuanced characters who experience relatable family struggles grief absolutely critical what makes movie effective resonant works metaphorical level using supernatural story vehicle explore very real way which family can absolutely ravaged tragedy furthermore how trauma mental illness passed through generations id remiss not mention toni collette gives mesmerizing performance film absolutely unhinged truly difficult stomach times,8
Hereditary,all praise excellent i think hereditary isnt quite masterpiece despite fact i very much invested riveted throughout length film there were some detectable pacing issues i feel conflicted saying because im very much fan slowburn horror style which benefits deliberate pace but i did get occasional nagging sense things couldve been tightened up just tad without losing effect some scares film often more traditional horror moments also struck slightly wrong note me first viewing were just hair too campy onthenose given how visionary restrained majority film its ending few minutes film really shows its full hand when bit more ambiguity may have served better,7
Hereditary,positives far far outweigh negatives here though hereditary ultimately remarkable debut horror film which showcases what genre capable when its taken seriously talented director heres hoping well continue see more like,8
Hereditary,light 455,9
Hereditary,acting movie far its redeeming trait there so much creepiness go around toni collette owned her role i felt extremely uncomfortable couple points almost regretted going theater alone,9
Hereditary,all changed last 10 minutes movie little over two hours so thats long emotional investment but then you get twist starts get hokey lame spookiness up until point had now turned into what felt like last ditch effort end movie one point movie my mouth hanging open shock horror when end credits started rolling my mouth hanging open disappointment if you want love movie leave 15 minutes before its over just make up ending your mind youll feel much more satisfied,7
Hereditary,bit old fashioned horror movie something plays dramatic movie first then slowly becomes something else like rosemary exorcist but without high profile clout those directors two hours exploration family tragedy grief through characters struggling cope,5
Hereditary,say much film ruin so lashing praise onto certain aspects best one can do not say film big twist isnt toni collette fantastic no surprise point her career all performances carry their own including one i unsure first but grew me throughout alex wolff cinematography rhythms pacing sense place space sound design all superb work conjunction create atmosphere dread like pit your stomach continues grow grow throughout,8
Hereditary,turns into genuine nightmare absolutely worked me see blind see movie first foremost not horror show jump scares but just see,9
Hereditary,i loved first 100 minutes hereditary psychological anguish brilliantly acted superb cast visuals feel like wes anderson gone wrong atmosphere dread despair recalls great psychological horror classics like rosemarys baby,10
Hereditary,then we get twist what lame twist moment collette starts climbing walls like spiderman gliding about like scoobydoo ghost atmosphere broken,10
Hereditary,hereditary most compelling when horror comes awful tragedy young girls death emotional hell family goes through aftermath blaming one another i spent much movie terrified mother would break down completely kill her own son,10
Hereditary,twist such conventional letdown felt so so boilerplate something youd get conjuring,8
Hereditary,only reason isnt lower than 710 me because first half just so great too bad couldnt make landing,10
Hereditary,loved movie wasnt hard figure out once peaked but getting there great i see people dont like film i can understand but reminded me rosemarys baby thats saying lot story unfolds you see how truly horrifying persons toni collette life has been performances spot movie really ramps up last twenty minutes its not fir everyone but creeped me out i watch lot horror give shot its well worth,4
Hereditary,great acting all round great story deeply scary moments will leave you feeling haunted,5
Hereditary,i rarely write reviews films here exception two cases when movie really bad when movie needs defending vocal minority trash first ill review film like i would any other then im going try reason why audiences reacting negatively film im not sure if hereditary greatest horror film ever but i certainly felt like i watching my generations exorcist rosemarys baby movie borrows heavily those two films right down final scene despite feels new dangerous i had no idea how movie going play out which criticism i have lot modern horrorthriller movies large part has do marketing campaign but more later i feel term slow burn has negative connotation associated prefer call movie tense doesnt really jump scares plague lot modern horror chooses tension imagery scare audience slow camera panning fantastic cinematography nervous score great performances toni collette gives incredible performance manic mother who mourning loss parent supporting cast fantastic well they all have time shine some point movie movie also challenging its themes relationships between parents their children always forefront human drama movie far exceeded my expectations worthy viewing its own right,2
Hereditary,try explain why audiences trashing film through some mediums not much imdb see cinemascore rotten tomatoes example i think important understand we live impatient culture many horror classics past like two i mention earlier werent fast paced instead lingered images favored slow paced horror i think modern horror audience can get restless when presented movie like i dont think rosemarys baby exorcist would review very well broad audiences if they were released today secondly i think film has succeeded making people uncomfortable questioning parents feelings their children how they displayed movie complex has lot say comparing film another fantastic horror movie year quiet place offers great juxtaposition idea one very simple its premise quickly gets scares while other takes its time build climax may may not worth wait depending viewer overall hereditary offers plenty horrific imagery supernatural scares work deeper examination familial relationships rather than being string horror movie cliches,1
Hereditary,910 excellent,10
Hereditary,hereditary sort like two films one half time being what i expected which horror movie other half though plays out much like drama i would even suggest its better film when its drama mode than when its horror mode film over 2 hours length which extremely long modern horror movie standards reason i believe its trying fit so much achieve so much such little time its very ambitious film would have said,1
Unhinged,theres nothing wrong decent thriller where two people face off road using their wits their heavy machinery so movie could have been duel 1971 2020s very least joy ride 2001 but unfortunately lacks director like steven spielberg john dahl make work,5
Unhinged,after shocking opening scene director derrick borte starts off nicely disturbing montage shows us horrible consequences explosive aggression road rage long time his movie seems passionate plea have more patience compassion others harsh society where everyone under constant pressure because you never know what other person going through too bad he gradually undermines message cheap shocks sadistic violence,10
Unhinged,its good see russell crowe again after such long absence because watching his heavily disturbed maniac snap terrorize lady just happened piss him off definitely one scarce highlights film no oscar material but man still acting heavyweight no pun intended well maybe little so much so leading lady caren pistorius cannot hope carry movie his presence fact her character so passive uninteresting i felt very little sympathy her plight i dont know if intention here but i always love movies where you cheer bad guy very long time like faceoff law abiding citizen everyone loves tragic villains you always hope makers can delay moment where you lose sympathy them until very last,5
"Yes, God, Yes",karen maines yes god yes won me over its slice 2000s nostalgia way portrayed some very relatable things lives teenagers those times story little too simplistic doesnt try bite off more than can chew sense films climax probably wont seem too revolutionary when viewed 2020 where sinning more innuendo than something religious,6
"Yes, God, Yes",there some predictable turns there some funny moments theres little sexual exploration something film could have dwelled more given its theme theres neat central performance natalia dyer 25yearold playing highschool teenager i really enjoyed her adorable facial expressions most part films only 77 minutes long so doesnt take up much your time telling straightforward unsurprising story,10

The Lion King,wellthe visual effects groundbreaking but lacks heart flare feels soulless compared original donald glover beyoncé felt like miscasts feels like theyre reading lines sheet see remake visual effects but go back watch original animated masterpiece all its glory,6
The Lion King,original lion king one my favorite movies all time if you feel same id recommend you never watch remake now let me explain how movie completely ruined,1
The Lion King,1 characters have no facial expressions so original if you just turned off sound youd still able understand whats going body language facial expressions were big part what brought these characters life new film simba looks like real lion similar real lion he has zero facial emotion true all characters,3
The Lion King,2 voice acting horrible everyone talks incredibly unemotional slow these actors have likely been told production do so otherwise would have looked weird these animals move their mouths so fast even mufasas voice far slower less emotional while its still same voice actor they really talk half speed have odd pauses their dialogue emotion gone entirely,1
The Lion King,3 clever jokes small exchanges not movie because characters talk so slowly they cant say much therefore all small jokes clever exchanges left out few kept but fall flat timing off now instance when original simba nala go elephant graveyard hyena have all these fun exchanges they left out movie instead we get 2 hyenas particularly unfunny,1
The Lion King,4 songs ruined original movie songs bend real physics reality give expressive montage visually stunning here they just walk jog bitthen few other animals might appear but thats about songs also played slower tempo which itself ruined all momentum out song,1
The Lion King,5 simba unlikable before simba flees away pride rock you feel his character bit reckless bit cocky but he also brave has characteristics leader he protects others elephant graveyard he stands up zazu while he does not even like zazu saying hyenas should pick somebody their own size when he nala then have run their lives nala falling behind simba then runs back saves her scratching shenzi these 2 things do not happen remake which make simba cocky guy only caring about power he will get king second half youll start wonder if he really should king,1
The Lion King,6 filler scenes there few additonal scenes things dragged out give zero character development do not bring new information all youll notice these scenes film but give 1 example ill tell one thats least spoilery remember mouse scar grabs under his hand beginning you see him run up camera wash his nose bamn scar has him under his paws remake we see mouse crawl whole minute why later movie there something took original 5 seconds too but here takes 2 minutes theyre really struggling make movie 1 hour 50 minutes whereas i do not think its necessary all they could have just made movie 1 hour 25 minutes original,1
The Lion King,movie has no soul leaves bad taste towards originaldisney has lost all its credibility respect still had left making atrocious movie,2
The Lion King,movie adequate thats not good enough live action though lion king masterpiece story has been celebrated years its emotional timeless value version falls really short voice acting flat tone wrong there little no emotion felt during very slow boring few hours,1
The Lion King,only highlight my opinion seth rohan billy eisner past very forgettable hollow version story,5
The Lion King,oh beyoncé over sings everything,1
The Lion King,just clear my all time favorite movie i cant stress enough i love lion king 1994 but what i saw today horror me cgi good but everything else wasnt i would recommend you watch movie only so you can appreciate original its true value they ruined again cant stress enough songs especially prepared actors were awful plain flat except james earl jones seth rogen john oliver beyonce really anyone else couldve done better job i mean anyone had no emotion what so ever none,3
The Lion King,missed important scenes first movie like 1 rafiki hitting simba stick saying its past 2 smartfunny conversation between hyenas simbanalazazu many more,1
The Lion King,i wanted cry when mufasa died but i couldnt because all happens 20 seconds flat,1
The Lion King,also i wanted cry end movie because horrible,1
The Lion King,cgi incredible its mesmerising beautiful but thats all beautiful cgi theyve completely lost sight story emotion magic its so boring focus has been so much keeping photo realistic everything else has been forgotten about theyve cut numbers when mufasa dies you feel nothing because characters arent showing any emotion none acting convincing really badly cast fur so intricate especially attention detail when gets wet its very very telling where money has gone get go,1
The Lion King,lion king only movie growing up actually made me cry soundtrack alone amazing but there magic cartoon version new one awful they spent tons money tech actors but forgot add magic isnt lion queen its not about beyonce but its become all about her when she didnt actually bring anything movie james earl jones will never get bad review my book he did his job everyone else simply forgettable cartoon version i remember each actor each song each joke etc i havent watched years my guess disney making all these worthless remakes maintain copyrights those movies but theres 0 intention do same magic formula captivated people beginning only remake ive enjoyed so far cinderella we even bought rest i dont even remember my kids prefer cartoon versions over remakes now too should say something not anyone disney will care their goal take over everything continue being control taking heaps money their own exploits ill stick original lion king including soundtrack broadway show also amazing never speak waste money film again,1
The Lion King,felt like corporate movie they know people will go see name alone they ruined music not sure they realized music best part songs felt like when artist oversings national anthem songs were great originally felt like they were trying too hard,1
The Lion King,visually beautiful thank god james earl jones mufasa other than just blah acting flat didnt even hold candle original but worst beyonce way too much nala beyonces stupid singing,2
The Lion King,such emotional original movie i felt no emotions watching version instead i found myself agitated frustrated wanting go home watch original there clearly something lost lifelike remake,1
The Lion King,i love original i wanted love movie i over moon excited they took out too many important parts original showing strength mufasa but also his friendly side his friendship zazu how he respects hugs rafiki he taught simba how pounce even opening scene wasnt same why would you alter huge rising sun tune music gives almost everyone goosebumps new one you see trees slightly lit up morning sky then small sun appears off side isnt sync music mufasas personality doesnt sound same even though its still james earl jones voice its different somehow hyenas not same they dont make jokes laugh themselves like make mine cub sandwich then laugh hysterically their own jokes they eliminated ed one who doesnt speak just laughs timon isnt flamboyant half funny original hula scene original fast paced funny distract hyenas new one he slowly sings our guest no action not fun fact all new characters including beyoncé sound like they just reading script its really mundane forced none them character flow like original theres no sass wit music boring its huge disappointment rafiki catches simbas hair knows immediately its him original he knows scent but takes him minute figure out when he does hes ecstatic not remake there no image mufasa clouds guide simba remember who he rafiki doesnt give him lesson about how past can hurt his stick simba doesnt hug rafiki like his father did which also symbolic how simba like his father i dont understand why disney would eliminate these bonds characters we all love change make what visually stunning movie into something i will never want see again,1
The Lion King,far away one my top movies all time definitely movie i can say lines pretty much whole way through,1
Double Jeopardy,if you listen critics who knows where we would i,8
Double Jeopardy,ignored comments another fugitive only female version but found movie fast paced well acted tommy lee jones ashley judd well whole cast i liked story line exciting time just flew go see you will enjoy,8
Double Jeopardy,two really good lead actors people i like watch tommy lee jones ashley judd plus ontherunfugitivetype story i expected lot i wasnt disappointed either although its bit hokey,7
Double Jeopardy,very intense involving story la abovementioned fugitive except time its woman chasing down her exhusband who set her up murder once again we see jones his familiar role chasing down supposedcriminal,10
Double Jeopardy,interesting story there some credibility gaps such why jones didnt have picture exhusband first place alwaysannoying hesitationbeforeshooting end which saves good guyand few other things like which unrealistic will hollywood ever stop nonsense,7
Double Jeopardy,however clichés aside overall its very entertaining always fun watch no matter how many times i see both judd jones excellent these kind roles,7
Double Jeopardy,when you convicted something like killing your husband you can not convicted second time same crime sounds logical since you cant kill someone twice but when your dead husband suddenly shows up you want your revenge you can get since youve already had punishment these circumstances libby parsons ashley judd finds herself after she released prison six years after her conviction how why husband bruce greenwood framed her not really important he just did now libby tries track him down matty their son her main reason problem travis lehman tommy lee jones her parole officer who strict his rules he does not believe her but course we understand will slowly change,7
Double Jeopardy,double jeopardy belongs group thrillers where you expect certain things happen you will see you were right not bad thing but means road those predictable moments must have something offer film has some things one them ashley judd maybe because i always like ashley judd but me she reason film entertained me she plays clever libby way keeps her serious but sometimes quite funny well especially sarcastic little remarks made me smile more than once tommy lee jones reliable always especially fugitive kind roles like one scenes between him judd entertaining themselves greenwood turns out nice villain,4
Double Jeopardy,simply said if you do not expect too much double jeopardy there good chance you will have really good time,10
Double Jeopardy,ashley judd very beautiful apt role way she characterizes wifea mother victim too good hats off ashley judd after elizabeth taylor i like acting skill fine women ppl watch movieits nice dose suspenseromance dose other emotions well ashley judd did her best story subtle good screen play good direction all all good investment time watch ashleythey say movie has some issue legal interpretation some legal point but i think has no relevance movie so far way screen play donei believe movie doesnt weigh interpretation alone climax just sinks into us without gravity i personally think though story goodashley carried excellently well extremely delicate one infinite thanks beauty actor person thanks all,6
Double Jeopardy,ive read all bad reviewsi can say its really not badgrantedthis picture has no realism whatsoever buti could rattle off names many movies even more unbelievable still considered good films,7
Double Jeopardy,not really good film anythingbut does what does wellwhich get your attention hold itno great analysis no deep conversations afterward about what all meant just bit time away day day life,4
Double Jeopardy,movie also trying appeal particular crowd type who like these type mind thrillersguilty sin another one malice final analysis etc etc theres whole host movies like one,7
Double Jeopardy,now particular movie stars ashley judd who so talented she almost had me thinking she really locked updefinitely quality actressand if your female have just had really bad breakup you may wanna see woman will triumph quality,10
Double Jeopardy,not im saying movie great but i always tend look bad goodi thought one worst thrillersa lot worse then malice kidman alec baldwinthat one not only improbable but also extremely boringbut im getting off subject hand,7
Double Jeopardy,i liked saw theater rooted ashley all way,10
Double Jeopardy,seen lot worse my time,1
Double Jeopardy,lastly if you wanna check out ridiculous moviesand its sequel boot rent revenge stepford wives,4
Double Jeopardy,nick parsons played bruce greenwood wants protect his ill gotten wealth so he fakes his own demise his wife libby played ashley judd convicted murder while prison libby finds out her husband still alive has taken her son new orleans living under assumed name,10
Double Jeopardy,upon release mrs parsons breaks parole order get her son back one other thing she realizes she can kill her husband real not suffer consequences tommy lee jones plays parole officer trying bring her back custody he ends up helping libby,1
Double Jeopardy,miss judd very beautiful probably screen 97 movie no objection here jones outstanding action thriller worth seeing more than once,1
Double Jeopardy,but enough about ashley judd,1
Gone Girl,i never wrote review before my life so please excuse my poor attempt but after reading some reviews i just felt i had give try,7
Gone Girl,i really thought movie very good its starts typical missing wife husband main suspect no body yet found tale we all have seen once our lives but after first act really gets extremely unsettling special i felt sick between because horrible frightening character amy i cant describe any further think you should simply give try,8
Gone Girl,spoilers,10
Gone Girl,i now would like address certain plot holes many people have been pointing out,8
Gone Girl,first all every movie has plot holes im usually first notice even though there were some things bothered me i got over them quite quickly since movie had tight grip me,10
Gone Girl,many mentioning different cameras desis house first all i know many surveillance cameras overwrite their data after some time so very likely only last few days where she never left entered house would available police second all far i could see cameras only showed outside house not what happening house thats why she went near window which within perimeter one cameras do her screaming attack if you pay attention you never see amy appearing any cameras when she checks them only when she actually wants seen,6
Gone Girl,i could address many other so called plot holes i dont think they actually were plot holes per se but made intentionally order us watchers gobut wait how does she get away think police officer who doubt amys statements even lawyer,9
Gone Girl,what fincher my opinion wanted demonstrate exemplary control amy had over public were no questions were asked nobody ever doubted her kind symbolic witch hunts we ourselves have witnessed tv social media were no second opinion sought nobody looks story second angle amy personification american sweetheart treated such just shows us how blind angry crowd gets when you push certain buttons amy herself actually talks about car scene pregnant intelligent wife who cheated her husband poor girl next door who always nice strange kid rich guy who thought he could have everything,1
Gone Girl,basically story thats why film so intriguing my opinion its mirror how our society age internet social media tv etc functions how we can tricked into anger sadness how little people actually question certain statements,2
Gone Girl,i like when movie can keep me guessing until end gone girl just did most time i didnt know where film going each new twist turn surprise you cant help but get pulled into story actors all gave excellent performances well i dont think ill ever able look some them same way again movie what crime thriller should,1
Gone Girl,how earth film attracting so much criticism one best films 2014 people labelling utter tripe enormous heap illogic nonsense wish i had missed these people serious can we no longer appreciate even identify great film,1
Gone Girl,gone girl peerless plotdriven story about wife who goes missing seems pretty ordinary right well its not doesnt take very long all any sane viewer recognise,10
Gone Girl,you start watching you do any mystery you start collecting clues piecing together explanation events which have taken place but no sooner than you have formed perfect explanation your mind immediately swept away most overwhelming twist year,1
Gone Girl,only gets better there,1
Gone Girl,gone girl rollercoaster only youre riding dark you dont know where next turn you cant see where youre headed you have no idea how many more ups downs youre going experience before its all over,1
Gone Girl,its film keeps you guessing just youre beginning once again think youve got all figured out game changes its all up air once more,4
Gone Girl,diaryexposition format also very clever executed perfectly many films fall victim losing viewer when jumping back forth between past present yet gone girl you guessed does just right,8
Gone Girl,film ranks high mysterythriller genre just compelling perplexing shutter island if not then moreso,1
Gone Girl,lets not forget acting ben affleck rosamund pike do phenomenal job their roles husband wife not line feels out place both seem though they were born play nick amy dunne end film i felt so immersed their story i found hard believe just film,8
Gone Girl,all all i one am thoroughly pleased gone girl i knew watching trailer would something i would like i just never imagined could thrill me much,10
Gone Girl,very underrated overwhelming story should enjoyed all,1
Gone Girl,wow actually thriller thats pretty good yes its fair say gone girl really engrossing film almost every film its based book most films based book i havent read book so i havent got clue how well film relates source material but then i dont care i just enjoyed ride,7
Gone Girl,gone girl one those films where you dont want say too much about fear giving things away spoiling people who havent seen ben affleck plays reasonably decent husband whose welltodo wife disappears media circus follows then starts reveal truth far more complicated first seems not mention obligatory police investigation its fair say what follows film twists turns so you only really get one chance watch not know whats coming,1
Gone Girl,many people dont really like affleck when comes acting even less now hes due don batsuit but i think most people will relate him he gets pursued hounded unfairly youll have wait see media rosamund pike plays his gone wife flawless american accent again youll have see whether shes found alive dead story bounces around back forth time making sure youre just confused enough never put too much together before films ready reveal whats happening,1
Tombstone,its funny but i notice most prior comments guys but speaking woman no means just guys flick its been one my favorite films since day came out its got everything drama romance action honest goodness story there even interesting themes like moral dilemma wyatt finds himself he compelled help fight cowboys even though hes retired just wants live out his life peace there moral equivalence between killing justice killing retribution how far can man go sacrifice his own integrity better judgment even though earps good guys movie doesnt glamorize violence doc holliday some earps other sidekicks creek johnson texas jack obviously pretty shady characters but end day forced choose between right wrong they choose correctly doesnt get much better than val kilmers performance doc holliday i cant life me understand why he didnt get nominated i also appreciate fact love story between wyatt josephine didnt dominate film take away real plot ala titanic love story simply served its purpose helping viewers better understand character wyatt also friendship between wyatt doc portrayed tenderly but not wussily okay woman let me just say there no one sexier than sam elliot man alive if there ever person born portray cowboy guy if youve never seen western not fan try movie will make believer out you,9
Tombstone,probably best western i have ever seen if mostly due kilmers outstanding portrayal doc holliday he lacks my opinion much gruffness john wayne which although good gets boring after so many films look ringos face when he realises his opponent holliday not earp priceless shows you just how great reputation doc has man praised deadliest pistoleer since wild bill now making excuses not go up against him russels performance also commendable showing man who has seen too much blood his life wishes simply settle down but kilmer simply cannot ignored drunken but suave gambler,10
Tombstone,tombstone one two epic westerns about wyatt earp released within few months each other 199394 lacks lyrical wartsandall quality kevin costners wyatt earp but more successful film tighter pacing more clearly drawn characters reverence genre has made most popular western last twenty years,9
Tombstone,opening scene narrated legendary robert mitchum nod great hollywood westerns past evident gang outlaws calling themselves cowboys break up mexican wedding small town ruthlessly killing nearly all men including village priest pedro armendáriz jr son legendary western actor scene reminiscent once upon time west magnificent seven led two hollywoods flashiest character actors swaggering powers boothe coldly psychotic michael biehn playing johnny ringo presence such pure evil sets stage earps arrival tombstone,10
Tombstone,powerful cast essential great western you couldnt find better group actors earp brothers kurt russell chiseled squintyeyed razorthin ideal wyatt sam elliott one hollywoods best western actors plays virgil growl but twinkle his eye bill paxton soon achieve stardom apollo 13 twister makes terrific morgan then there val kilmer doc hollidaywhile dennis quaid wyatt earp gave most realistic portrayal dying dentistturnedgamblergunfighter ever recorded film he superb kilmer relying bloodshot eyes ambiguous sexuality brandoesque line delivery literally steals tombstone has become doc everyone remembers he so charismatic you nearly forget earps focus story watch his early scene confronting shotgunwielding chubby billy bob thornton three years before sling blade out kill wyatt youll see my point,8
Tombstone,events leading up famous gunfight ok corral clearly decisively presented wyatts first meeting future wife josie dana delany murder tombstones marshal harry carey jr son another legendary western star staple many john ford films which leads virgil taking badge making his brothers wyatts case reluctantly deputies friction ike clanton gods generals stephen lang explodes into short but bloody shootout became legendary,8
Tombstone,where tombstone wyatt earp both excel presenting aftermath gunfight unlike my darling clementine gunfight ok corral true story doesnt tie up neatly happy ending corral but becomes darker bloodier earps placed under house arrest after they acquitted court friends clanton tombstone ringo other cowboys coldbloodedly murder morgan cripple virgil wyatt explodes grimly sets about holiday small band gunmen execute every possible clanton ally he can find you tell him im coming hells coming me becoming wanted fugitive himself he only stops his mission vengeance long enough take ailing holiday friends cabin charlton heston has brief but memorable cameo rancher but gambler returns time gunblazing climax film,10
Tombstone,tombstone kind western critics love say arent made anymore throwback golden days ford hawks when good evil were clearly defined director george p cosmatos grew up those films well those sergio leone he said tombstone made honor westerns he loved so much,9
Tombstone,his love western makes tombstone truly superior film,8
Tombstone,i wont review film here has all been said before i did want praise val kilmers portrayal doc holiday throughout entire film his acting character embellishments so nuanced well done movies end we feel his loss very personal way credit must also go out costumers makeup artists their contribution overall effect his role all way through film he looks sickly pale worldweary his mannerisms intensity gaze profoundly establish character focal point production but what i started off i consider role probably very best val kilmer required subtlety careful restraint made viewer believe we werent watching actor merely regurgitating lines hitting their footmarks i one entranced carefully studied body language facial expressionsthe sweaty desperation man who sensed his own mortality but strove enact his own justice justices sake just very well done,8
Tombstone,tombstone has one most truly touching brilliant films i have ever seen action sequences great acting brilliant particular val kilmer doc holliday what probably best supporting actor role i have ever seen how he missed out oscar i do not know,10
Tombstone,kurt russell very good wyatt earp played role very well all acting superb cowboys who baddies film had presence style gave heroes some proper competition,8
Tombstone,but val kilmers film doc he had style charisma looked cool even when his character terminally ill his sayings were also legendary val kilmer should go down film legend role alone,9
Tombstone,tombstone best non john wayne western i have seen,10
Tombstone,tucson native i totally impressed most people other parts world will believe any western saguaro movie one best all time i worked old tucson if youre looking historical timeline forget its condensed dramatic purposes but still flows its got love action comedymostly kilmer serious story what old west really like amen one opposed tragic quick dead which kinda silly if your brain turned whilst watching watch priestlys um unusual performance also has great back story earps life which makes much more than shallow shootem up movie,7
Tombstone,i decided watch tombstone there nothing else i am so glad i did,5
Tombstone,conforming i do stereotypical female who does not like westerns mainly kurt russell val kilmer drew me,9
Tombstone,not knowing much about ok corral i envisioned long drawn out gunfight scene somewhere out desert discover happened middle town only one educational experiences,3
Jaws,i will never forget first time i saw jaws i glued seat start finish i jumped i held my breath one experiences made me fall love movies probably first film where i completely forgot everything around me i there boat gloomy cabin those people everything seemed so real alas sea never looked same again when i watch these days i still marvel atmosphere performances film simply magical spielberg without schmalz he has never been better,10

Jaws,jaws original summer blockbuster setting standard which all others measured its michael jordan cinema there will never another jaws simply because film so profoundly changed way movies made marketed,9

Artemis Fowl,soon i saw artemis fowl insecure dependant boy who nothing all like criminal cold steady determined witty mastermind books i felt so let down he even surfs movie artemis would never turn sports disney just had make main character likeable weak little boy terrible movie nothing all compared terrific books written eoin colfer there has not been looked story all,1
Artemis Fowl,shame you disney,2
Artemis Fowl,before i watch movie i had heard people say pretty bad but i knew based book so i thought people may have hated because didnt live up isnt case just bad movie,3
Artemis Fowl,so boring like aimless top off also really nonsensical confusing i dont feel like i watched movie because i couldnt tell you anything about its just like blur,4
Artemis Fowl,acting pretty bad i dont know why but when i watching i just got like early 2000s vibe i dont know why like i think would have done better if made then just had type feel,2
Artemis Fowl,writing also pretty bad too never good when movie doesnt make you want read book its based,2
Bombshell,i didnt know much story when all happened possibly cause im based australia american scandal but whole story so powerful should shared across globe,8
Bombshell,when gretchen carlson nicole kidman let go her job fox news she sues ceo roger ailes john lithgow sexual harassment going up against powerful man even more powerful company gretchen seeks help other female employees come forward speak up make end man,8
Bombshell,i really enjoyed film but felt i couldve enjoyed even more if i knew more about story when happening saying didnt make film confusing bad any form its powerful story needs shared how woman can treated workplace hopefully spreads message inappropriate sexual behaviour never acceptable should spoken up about,5
Bombshell,nicole charlize margot were all so damn good film three incredible ladies i wouldve liked have seen bit more margots character but i then learnt after her character isnt part real life scandal,7
Bombshell,great movie start off new year,5
Bombshell,i hesitant first watch movie i couldnt imagine watching anything nearly two hours long about fox network but sometimes happens when i look onestar reviews haters convinced me give try if film enrages them so much they driven defend two old white guys who were fired their own far right bosses sexual abuses movie must pretty hard hitting,3
Bombshell,i found entertaining i gather one main characters isnt real person but rather sort amalgam many women who were sexually abused either left fox were disposed other ways i liked husband who supported his famous wife so loyally got kick out shenanigans lesbian character had go through stay hidden plain sight i never expect documentary these films so small changes dont enrage me provide onestar ammunition i have certain frame mind watch documentaries anyway,4
Bombshell,so if you gun carrying member far right tribe perhaps you should skip movie save yourself trouble posting one sentence review im here you guys,4
Bombshell,bombshell 5 out 10 consistently disengaging,6
Bombshell,charles randolph cowriter best adapted screenplay oscar winner big short adam mckay based book micheal lewis wrote bombshell he should not allowed write alone,4
Bombshell,material he had work bombshell had every opportunity engaging however horribly executed maybe 1 good scene tension drama there cautionary foremessage about presence dramatisation movie there no way movie less boring than real events occurred,8
Bombshell,no character given any depth only distinguishing feature being alist actor part randolph could not choose focus story not any characters even main issue followed any significant degree instead movie diverts unnecessary tangents about what our characters up their personal lives what i can only assume attempt humanise cardboard cutouts i couldnt care any characters,3
Bombshell,acting standpoint i managed spot 3 good actors charlize theron margot robbie john lithgow lithgows performance genuinely engaging most therons few australian accents movie murdoch family were laughable they parkoured between british american haveheardofaustralia levels accuracy,3
Bombshell,maybe earlier draft script kate mckinnon served purpose bill oreilly more than name margot robbie wasnt reduced extended cameo but these only some useless elements made movie feel hour longer than,9
Bombshell,thematically story hollow only thing movie says sexual harassment bad delivering message beyond safe barely registers message randolph unable even fully commit any political view such significant event certain scenes trying apolitical political displaying antitrump notions whilst emphasising reliability integrity fox news only slight left lean leaving story forgettable trump sections were played cute references however seeing how reflects my political ideology must good 1010,2
Bombshell,but wait isnt hypocritical such big hollywood movie condemn sexual harassment whilst also practicing far more toxic culture than fox news office no because movie antisexualharassment so i think they learnt their lesson,3
Bombshell,there were very few scenes significant cgi use but boy were those 2 scenes very distracting actor roof looked like they were floating surrounding buildings rooftop antennae looking less real than their wigs actor not well composited into archive footage,7
Bombshell,consider me thoroughly disappointed should win any 3 oscars nominated probably not,4
Bombshell,excellent acting makeup transformed actors real life people they portrayed interesting take fox news scandal mix movie made news real news awesome,8
Bombshell,i found story very interesting but i think absolutely impossible fit all interesting details actually help you comprehend story 15 hours movie tv show loudest voice you get live story through you actually see what kind person ra especially towards women me tv show year so movie me felt way too short way too fast its hard follow understand what actually going like watching rewind acting fantastic i think everyone did great job but story too superficial not deep enough my taste,9
Bombshell,true story would have been compelling enough able send its own merit before movie starts there disclaimer story inspired actual events characters events have been added drama really so knowing they have basically made stuff up enhance drama you dont know what believe i think women deserved better than have their stories embellished,4
Bombshell,film wouldve been great one if they actually went full what doing but sadly we just get shallow film feels like only made people hollywood literally no one else earth theres lot about actual real life subject matter wouldve been great explore film while performances great just doesnt do subject justice,10
Bombshell,not even close tvseries loudest voice run same theme watch instead,10
Bombshell,while i wasnt all familiar story went behind scenes fox news i very intrigued see film tackling one very first stories women taking stand against powerful man abusing power while great story overall there lot elements missing here couldve made fantastic film film feels more like tool showcase how corporations have been run past but there wasnt enough depth really dive filled great performances true story worth exploring heres why i believe bombshell one big missed opportunity,8
Bombshell,film follows few main characters but centrepiece story fact roger ailes would sexually harass women order give them higher positions fox news he did years many these women kept silent order keep their jobs if film accurate gretchen carlson first one speak up many began follow her lead there lot information many insightful moments kept my attention but film severely suffers relying those two things more than anything bombshell wants get messages out but pacing slow felt like i watching newspaper article unfold onscreen,9
The Goonies,just prior graduating degree film studies lecturer asked us so whats your favourite film now whilst my peers spouted out goddard films obscure german expressionist shorts i sat quietly thinking my favourite film has been my favourite film since i seven so when came me i mumbled goonies i expecting scorn ridicule possibly minor injury but instead met concurring shouts whoops cries hey you guuys rest class you see unifying thing about goonies mention room full twentysomethings theyll whell up utter sloth loves chunk adopt harassed chinese tone thats what i saidbooty traps if room happens pub several chairs will scrape back semiinebriated grown men will lift their shirts shake their bellies revel truffle shuffle people may say its indiana jones wannabe i think defining beauty all when we first watched goonies like watching our dreams come true screen wed loved seeing indianas adventures escapades goonies we saw kids like us actually doing they got just like miniindies we imagined ourselves playground but its not just adventure makes us love film we love those goonies themselves they were like our friends we got annoyed them sometimes we wanted protect them we laughed their jokes cheered when they had brilliant plan identifying those kids what we loved why adults we quote them become them when talking about film i still want like andy having perilous adventure sliding down tunnels facing bad guys huge pirate ship but course also making time kiss brand mikey i also think why goonies 2 such relevant exciting concept weve all grown up together id love see how guys doing nowi just hope doesnt disappoint so if youve not seen do right now if you have kids sit them down hold their hand through scary bits enjoy theyll thank you twenty years time,10
The Goonies,anyone who grew up 80s will list goonies one their favourite films least look back misty eye,10
The Goonies,had everthing you could want thrills spills pirates booty adventure freaks bad guys i just wanted goonie go goonie style adventure even place where they lived cool big old house picturesque bay town you dont get houses like england only interesting thing you would have found my loft would have been dead pidgeon,10
The Goonies,then there were goonies themselves who just seemed so cool datas gadgets smart mouthed erm mouth,10
The Goonies,we first introduced them one one fantastic introductory sequence bad guys piece fratellis organise jailbreak huge 4x4 process doing so they speed past every member goonies introducing their character traits then they all get together leader mikies house just doss around while feeling sorry themselves because property magnate wants but there little town turn into country club although bay looks like would make poor golf course but hey so goonies last day together they have do something about dont they just,10
The Goonies,what follows like comedy hardy boys crossed game mousetrap some set pieces genius pirate one eyed willie had penchant elaborate traps stop people pinching his booty sets equally inventive gang get themselves into various scrapes traps fratellis both somehow always come out top,7
The Goonies,richard donners direction always brisk young actors performances superb specially fantastic chunk senior cast very good dialogue chock full hilarious lines,10
The Goonies,i must admit i look back through rose tinted glasses i awe when i kid now when i watch reminds me my childhood all things great about i cant fault goonies even now i still believe perfect kids film,10
The Goonies,i am probably preaching converted but if you havent seen goonies go buy now if you dont like what hell wrong you,10
The Goonies,2001 thereabouts i watched listened audio commentary track dvd version goonies nostalgia wonderful thing seeing how principal cast had aged hardly aged josh brolins case worth price admission its own but just one goonies selling points despite what imdbs ratings would have you believe immortal classic warrants repeated frequent viewings not coincidence many its cast crew have repeatedly appeared all sorts productions before since indeed probably first film introduced me reality same actor will often play ten different parts ten different films when i realised jonathan ke quan same brat made parts indiana jones temple doom so amusing seeing him videoenhanced commentary dvd nearly two decades later surprise half,10
The Goonies,film revolves around group children adolescents who live poorer less trendy part beachfront town unlike episode barney every member principal group given background string differences their castmates you will not see teenaged brand responding same situation same manner ten year old mikey where major part films strength derived only weakness characterisations martha plimpton kerri green who join adventuring boys little way into film exactly what they doing other than giving character brand something similar himself bounce his more adultoriented lines anyones guess but they do work their limited capacity just pity chris columbus screenplay did not give them little more do other than defuse one fiendish trap towards end ride,10
The Goonies,speaking fiendish traps adventurers journey one puzzling location next barely stop breath works because unlike similar adventure films where director expects us impressed fiendishsounding name specific places visited goonies have function bone piano shown one such sequence example would appear nightmares children learning regular piano years after films theatrical release also gives corey feldman good chance act out character who speaks very fluent spanish while i am subject who could forget immortal scene early film where mouth deliberately loses something translation when rosalita shown around but prize scenestealing goes john matuszak who plays unofficial eighth goonie sloth weird aplomb may well scare willies out parts intended audience but then 1985 scaring intended audience little considered healthy part making film those age ranges depicted here,4
The Goonies,they say you cannot have good protagonist without good antagonist bounce off robert davi joe pantoliano anne ramsey provide antagonists so good they utterly hose rule about not working animals children fratellis work so well here because they working children late anne ramsey played her part so well mere thought watching her anything scared willies out me years nowadays i have fully realised mechanics behind film some years i am keen mustard see some her other work such pieces throw momma train now theres title brings images mind meet hollowheads performance can produce two entirely different reactions same person different stages their life should tell you all you need know about its quality robert davi joe pantoliano somewhat overshadowed here but manic cackling quality their introductory act also left quite lasting impression,1
The Goonies,you might have noticed i have so far only mentioned special effects passing while heaping praise upon acting because unlike films such recent star wars prequels effects complement acting rather than overshadow what i am able tell all effects goonies practical some them quite inventive there no use blood squibs which may disappoint some viewers but there enough mechanical sets air vents fill three films some these effects did not turn out so well were cut final film squid sequence being most famous example but unlike lot films depend special effects crucial element everything shown final cut perfect sync here suspension disbelief never issue which just well considering some preposterous things roll screen certain nonchalance,10
The Goonies,i gave goonies ten out ten like superman original lethal weapon shows richard donner knows how make classic now twenty years old stands forever relic time when world those under age eighteen far less oppressive if you have not introduced your children around age ten greater its joys moments then shame you,3
The Goonies,treasure hunts who doesnt remember digging under porch creekbeds hollowed out logs etc find buried treasure you just know hidden there somewhere goonies funfilled ride right back into our youth where treasure hunts no longer thing past,10
The Goonies,i absolutely loved movie just so much fun watch when i kid just much fun when i watched again adult my own kids course movie has moments predictability no villains arent all intimidatingtheyre actually quite moronic but only adds charm movie well its comedic value although there lessons peppered dont judge appearances right vs wrong etc overall goonies wonderful exploration childhood friendships imaginationsfrom data his many scientific creations one eyed willy his pirate ship,9
The Goonies,there isnt character movie i didnt fully enjoy watchingyou have dimwitted evil fratellis heavyset melodramatic chunk data his booty trapsthats what i said booby traps galore oddlooking but loveable sloth mouth his well mouth those only fewthere many more lot great lines come movie along memorable moments truffle shuffle ive seen goonies about hundred times i still enjoy watching over over again,10
The Goonies,absolutely pure funfilled movie enjoy your kids grandkids nieces nephews simply yourself hang enjoy ride goonies earns solid 5 out 5 stars,10
The Goonies,every kid has imagined what would like go great glorious adventures pirate ships police chases treasure chests full gold surrounded human skeletons patches over eyes inherent excitement possibility cavernous wonder world beneath very streets where they live goonies about group kids who have grown up together about torn apart because their parents being forced sell their homes attic one their houses mikey played sean astin they find endless supply fascinating things treasure maps paintings cryptic writings strange languages they find map sounds promising decide see if has any value hoping able find enough treasure prevent their parents losing their homes,7
The Goonies,not only goonies brilliantly written directed acted movie but also so much fun adventures these kids through underground world while being chased despicable villains known fratellis fascinating watch goonies great cinematic experience has everything anyone who ever kid could ever want even elaborate sets very convincing,1
The Goonies,sense adventure hope presented goonies very uplifting inspiring lovable characters perfectly developed endlessly entertaining many them particularly sean astin corey feldman delivered best performances their future careers right here early adventure film movie can enjoyed virtually anyone which one its best values truly timeless should not missed,9
The Goonies,first time i saw goonies friends house right when new release video after best times i had my life watching friend established goonie club fun perhaps your past childhood memories would have been same too while movie tad heavy stupid foul jokes does have imagination willing trek around some perilous adventures plus few spooks there possibly never movie like providing tons fun laughter during time characters their personalities were most original including data his supply gadgets chunk his obese but likeable image love truffle shuffle but sloth easily stole show his own likeable personality goon weirdest face ive ever seen my life just think how fun discover lost treasure when you know its only fantasy four key things come mind goonies pirate ships teenagers frattellis cyndi lauper theyre actually good enough they go together memorable journey kudos richard donner bringing me movie ive seen over 100 times never stop enjoying after all these years im still waiting sequel,7
It,truly scariest movie all time if youre 10 years old younger maybe,5
It,i honestly am shocked all positive reviews high rotten tomatoes score did i see completely different movie,5
It,starts off very well genuinely good opening scene great cinematography atmosphere lighting likable child whom you connect easily interesting encounter takes place between kid very creepy clown dialogue good there eerie sense dread moment where aka pennywise goes being friendlyish clown terrifying villain instant through very well placed awkward stare moment i wasnt expecting gave me hope rest film then its all downhill there after almost laughable use cg,6
It,movie has big issues isnt scary its story weak if you can even call story has too many underdeveloped characters counterproductive villain no concrete rules what can can not do,4
It,overuse cg ruined any sense tension fear pennywises tactics didnt make sense if he feeds off fear why reveal himself each kids within close time period why not concentrate each child individually causing far more mental torment making them easier kill pennywise also just randomly manifests himself anywhere anytime disappears randomly i dont find scary when antagonist manifests itself attacks character right before doing damage vanishes,2
It,story mess there far too many characters i swear first 40 minutes longest montage film history montage each childs development exposure pennywise predictable monotonous story i dont know what say besides there really isnt one character motivations weak bill only one who makes sense where were parents not single parent seemed care about their missing children few screen parents there were came off caricatures there were few scenes felt completely pointless within context story school bully his dad being oddest,3
It,so closing uneven movie more accurately collection scenes dont flow well tangible story there some good laughs few entertaining scenes but all all its just average movie which shouldve been evident sign when original attached director cary fukunaga jumped ship,9
It,opening scene good there onnot much,1
It,i guess movie will please those not familiar book much more than those who being said i dont think possible make satisfying adaption without doing game thrones way more time needed dwell each novels parts create feel book gave us tell story told paper so i guess ill forgive filmmakers,6
It,kids okay theyve managed portray losers relationship between them decently enough considering running time again more time needed better development much what actually happened between kids has been cut but again running time they had,5
It,theyve changed setting 1958 80s bad choice so other changes theyre creating scenes arent book theyre changing things there biggest problem i have film execution horror constant jump scares way too much cgi complete lack understanding fact less more waiting scare scary part horror movie just throws everything you constantly just isnt terrifying all,9
It,i didnt find myself bored though besides poor performance when came being scary okay movie just isnt good adaptation,1
It,i think film good but didnt really live up expectations i didnt find scary admittedly one jump scares worked me but otherwise i never felt any dread looming pit my stomach film gorier than mini series thats sure i liked updated aspect but nothing particularly shocked me there quite bit special effects just were not very good i think thats big reason why i just wasnt very scared,1
It,other dumb thing i want mention sometimes characters fell into predictable horror movie tropes its just kind silly when theyve already been scared pennywise many times knows all isnt real yet will wander off one missing kids going come here i mean really youre going fall i think what does save film performances bill does good job pennywise however he does lack charm tim curry had but those were always going big shoes fill clown pun not intended kids though were amazing particular jaeden lieberher who played bill sophia lillis who played bev were standouts i also want give shoutout nicholas hamilton who played henry managing make me feel empathy bully finn wolfhard stranger things plays richie who meant jokester group finn does well character i just wish writers had laid off jokes some times youre supposed building tension kind gets ruined when he opens his mouth make joke about period blood whatever,1
It,i see potential film i think could have been really good i just think they spent too much focus shock value rather than building atmosphere,3
It,i dont even know what say there so much wasted potential here i will say cinematography location children losers club hold up really well film yet im still sitting here after seeing premiere im still shaking my head,1
It,here one thing me ruined movie if you dont want any spoilers i suggest you stop reading here goes,1
It,what going all cgi film computer animated graphics have never scared me movie littered seemingly terrible unimpressive visual effects i had feeling going happen after watching directors previous film mama anytime something seemingly scary anytime i thought hey movie might redeem itself almost instantaneously followed some cheap jump scare villain who computer animated look scary human eye easy detect how fake cgi can folks let me tell you movie relies incredibly heavily computer animated effects no incredible monster movie effects 80s here sad part about movie takes place 80s instead 50s like book what better way write beautiful love letter time period than get some natural realistic horrifying movie effects 70s had exorcist top notch real effects do you remember thing 1980s thhose practical effects still hold up day its truly sad see computer programs taking forefront create scares anyway im rambling,10
It,all you fans book out there spoiler alert again,9
It,you will disappointed only uses book small guideline story they decided craft here there no ritual chud there no mummy werewolf drowned children standpipe everything rushed film just complete mess pains me say so,1
It,if you havent read book maybe youll have decent time if you can handle cgi i one thought extremely disappointing confusing ultimately boring cliché god i wish could have gone different way,4
It,if you truly interested seeing pleaseplease save your money go see something else very least wait rent,3
It,im huge fan 1990s tv film especially its aesthetics soundtrack but left out lot content original novel leaving me confused when i first saw age 12 remake perhaps actually readaptation certainly very timely what stranger things becoming so huge pretentious hipsters everywhere im still not sure hits scary factor very well especially without tim currys tremendous acting but its certainly creepy its not nostalgic though nor does retain much original novel including 50s setting changed 80s obviously market itself stranger things goonies,5
It,my problem new adaptation its addled cgi jump scares neither which add its nostalgic appeal risk sounding like film snob if youre trying make film set decades before era you dont use cgi all if you can avoid unless you really know how camouflage constant profanity did nothing story either only gave false illusion being edgy yes book had profanity but king knew where draw line keep perfect balance immature vulgarity true friendship sheer level nerdiness here made me cringe unlike tv movie which had genuine friendships sweet moments love joy amidst horror just like kings novel did one those boys seriously just say get me my bifocals i hid them my second fanny pack what hell kind child wears bifocals why not just rename him poindexter while theyre kids book miniseries were never obnoxiously dorky whats all new kids block stuff there scene which no apparent reason all these closeups nkotb posters pop up onscreen why just because earlier film kid had been listening music made no sense we get loads terrible one liners richie comparing blood sewers period blood lovely eh trust me no way does any thirteenyearold talk like all kids age swear tell fart jokes stuff but even they have their limits,10
It,mike only added afterthought which seems borderline offensive if they only added him token minority whereas book film he such complex central character he had strong bond his father thats totally absent film stan unlikable newly revamped pennywise clown has teeth could rival most inbred hillbilly most scary thing he seems able do hop around like some kind wino uh yeah real spooky im shaking my boots,5
Titanic,you can watch movie 1997 you can watch again 2004 2009 you can watch 2015 2020 movie will get you every time titanic has made itself forever timeless classic i just saw today 2015 i crying my eyeballs out just like first time i saw back 1998 movie so touching so precise making boat acting storyline brilliant preciseness ship makes even more outstanding,10
Titanic,kate winslet leonardo dicaprio definitely created timeless classic can watched time time again will never get old movie will always continue beautiful painful tragic movie 1010 stars masterpiece,10
Titanic,titanic one my all time favourite films im 24 year old guy who has probably not cried front anyone since i kid but movie plays my emotions more than almost any other,10
Titanic,we all know ship will sink does even qualify spoiler but buildup event smugness over confidence assurances being unsinkable tease audience almost point where youre like really going sink,10
Titanic,i thought performances everyone were magnificent i cared about characters their lives beyond ship taking time introduce everyone weave their stories together masterful even beyond main characters like fabrizio murdoch first officer countless more heartbreaking towards end when you see panic gradually set slowly descends into total chaos you remember jack telling rose all places hes going take her you imagine their love filled lives together irish mother telling her children fairytale resigned their fate violinists trying maintain spirit composure amidst carnage music wow i cried all especially right end when you see photos roses life knowing shes fulfilled her promise survived living full life probably never having met anyone she loved much jack all those years ago,10
Titanic,visually pleasing every way dramatic musically astounding great acting above all fantastic story make undeniably iconic enduring film romanticdrama unlike any other deserves higher than 77,10
Titanic,very beautiful cinematic movie lots classic scenesalso extremely sad timesabsolute 90s classic,10
Titanic,ah yes film propelled leonardi dicapro super stardom became first film gross 1 billion stayed top box office charts 12 years only kicked off top another james cameron film avatar,10
Titanic,said titanic film most continuity errors all films despite though film indeed masterpiece sheer scale sets entire production were simply mind blowing sinking titanic greatest ship sinking scene ever done such meticulous detail one would think they actually really sunk ship off course not case though were all very elaborate sets most which were destroyed during making film,9
Titanic,leonardo made very likable hero quite frankly one lot guys can relate young lovers were so different yet so alike their love story almost endearing i must admit jumping backwards forwards time bit unnecessary resulted overlong epic they should only have told 1912 story apart film thrilling exciting fascinating every sense word,10
Titanic,good lord movie right here its masterpiece i am not exaggerating when i say tonight first time i watched i watched some parts earlier but i thought would probably boring i had better things do tonight i watched whole thing my grandmother i completely wrong best movie ive ever seen probably ever will see my entire life me my grandmother were both tears end there were two scenes which made me cry part where orchestra played nearer my god thee end when all those perished titanic applaud kiss rose jack movie absolutely amazing i would watch over over again,10
Titanic,every once while conversation will turn favorite movies ill mention titanic least couple people will snicker i pay them no mind because i know five years ago these same people were moved tears very movie theyre too embarrassed now admit,10
Titanic,i just rewatched titanic first time long time expecting simply enjoy story again i surprised find movie has lost none its power over these five years i cried again all same places brought me back 1997 when i can remember how movie no one thought would break even became most popular movie all time movie burst into public consciousness like no other movie i can recall yes even more than star wars today many people wont even admit they enjoyed folks lets get something straight you dont look cool when you badmouth film you look like out touch cynic,9
Titanic,no movie perfect one has few faults some dialogue falls flat some plot surrounding two lovers comes together little too neatly however none so distracting ruins film,10
Titanic,leonardo dicaprio kate winslet wonderful leo one fine actors his generation wait til you see him gangs new york before you call him nothing more than pretty boy kate winslet so strong film movie really hers she held together beautifully,9
Titanic,james cameron managed what many believed impossible recreating completely believable titanic sinking scenes were horrific just they were night how anyone can say effects were bad beyond me i utterly transfixed,10
Titanic,film one memorable scene after another titanic leaving port southampton rose jack bow flying iceberg right ahead screws hanging unbelievably out ocean screams doomed after she went down ending brought even burliest man theater tears,10
Titanic,music which has also been victim films success key ingredient james horners score simply perfect love theme beautiful tragic too bad celine dions pop song version had destroy great bit music so many,9
Titanic,i confess i am titanic buff such i relished opportunity see ship we never got see all its beauty perhaps watching sink affected me more than some because ive had such interest ship all my life however i doubt many those i saw crying were titanic buffs i applaud cameron bringing story masses way never demeaned tragedy film made such humanity,9
Titanic,another reviewer said better than i ever could open up your hearts titanic you will not disappointed,10
John Wick,john wick has very simple maybe even laughable plot typical guy takes his revenge movie can easily summarized keanu gets pissed shoots people face 101 minutes but thing you actually can see really keanu who doing instead shaky cameras dozens superfast cuts you can see kickass long takes which amazingly choreographed since their first film director duo has few problems storytelling but i am glad they made me realize how much i miss watching action movie actually see whats going,8
John Wick,its hard find anything bad say about john wick action beautifully choreographed setup surprisingly emotional action flick keanu what more there say if you love action even just like you will ride your life,9
John Wick,best way i can describe john wick picture taken but instead liam neeson its keanu reeves instead his daughter its his dog thats essentially plot movie john wick reeves out seek revenge people who took something he loved him its beautifully simple premise action movie when action movies get convoluted they get bad ie good day die hard john wick gives viewers what they want awesome action stylish stunts kinetic chaos relatable hero tie all together john wick succeeds its simplicity,8
John Wick,action movie buff all i wanted see movie some inventive action sequences i not disappointed every single action sequence movie fastpaced beautifully shot fluid intense you never have trouble understanding whats going direction film fantastic writing theres no melodramatic soapy story lines everything straight point point get action not one moment movie boring short dialogue effective getting action sequence sequence b without any confusion any characters motive its all laid out front you all you have do sit back enjoy insanity happening screen,7
John Wick,remember when live free die hard came out people were upset john mcclane only fired pistols throughout entire movie i like little versatility when comes action heroes evidently so do writers john wick wrecks face pistols assault rifles shotguns knives even manoamano man can do anything difference between john wick other modern action movies die hard 5 taken 3 instance you actually believe john wick killable hes not some invincible superhero like bruce willis die hard 5 having his car crash flip like hundred times second stops he gets out without scratch starts running no john wick takes beating film numerous times fact but most time hes kicking ass taking names instead acting some unstoppable killing machine he just seems like guy whos expert his field he used hitman after all,10
John Wick,john wick blast watch really its just mindlessly fun action movie has largescale shootouts cqc sequences classic herovillain handtohand confrontation end only negative i can say about movie villains arent anything write home about theyre russian mobsters which weve seen million times their leader isnt given enough work far character goes willam dafoe has brief but important role though wicks former colleague,8
John Wick,regardless john wick all about action goes above beyond every respect its breath fresh air after all poor sequels weve been getting thankfully john wick has potential next great action franchise absolute mustwatch action fans,7
John Wick,looks if filmmakers realized public sick certain movies most movies nowadays full wire work scifi etc often topped icing made needless predictable background stories add nothing example beautiful girlfriend who gives moral speeches troubled teenage daughter who arent present here,9
John Wick,nothing john wick john wick adds hardly story no character development no needless character background no misplaced drama no misplaced humor not too much eye candy nothing what john wick offers action action more action fact one long action scene some lines close ups added but not problem directors promise action deliver while delivering they made look good convincing without trying more theyre smart enough give movie satisfying beginning ending,9
John Wick,those who claim keanu reeves horrible actor you right but his blank expression perfect movie leave acting bad guys delicious guest part willem dafoe,8
John Wick,if youre tired movies forced drama loaded cgi john wick will pleasant wakeup call,10
John Wick,john wick 2014 best revenge flick keanu reeves 2014 matrix 1999 john wick 2014 another action fast paced entertaining slick action packed film which kind i have never seen before very fun straightforward action movie 80s sensibility its nice see keanu doing these types roles again one my personal favorite keanu reeves movies keanu reeves bad ass what great action packed blood packed film movies should really learn how make decent action film especially crap we getting today like escape plan bullet head such film me greatest action film come out century keanu phenomenal action so fast paced exciting my jaw literally dropped keanu took out all bad guys i personally think film better then all taken films combined simply brilliant made 20 million dollars i am glad made 40 million us i think film deserved make 100 million,1
John Wick,old school action no shaky cam definitely best stuntmanturneddirectordebut ive ever seen story set about john wick keanu reeves retired assassin who gets dragged back into his field when russian mob put hit out him but instead killing john they steal his classic mustang kill his newly acquired puppy sets john out exact revenge whole mob no nonsense kind waymultiple shots chest one head good measure type justice ive never seen film where gun play point precise i dont know what body count but its gotta up thereway up there ohand another thingthey actually reload guns dont see often films its got all star cast cameosmall roll characters ian mcshane william dafoe john leguizamo i swear one bad guy henchman mayhem insurance guy one best movie keanu reeves ever made start finish non stop action all scenes look very realistic best action movie year,2
John Wick,i love movie so much i think people behind movie made great astonish action movie there other things movie i love so much i even think john wick so much better than 47 ronin 2013 keanu reeves made most i love movie adrianne palicki ms perkins i think she did one best job portraying playing most memorable female assassin i have ever seen ms perkins made me realized inspired me there lot women who choose occupation female assassin hired mob there were lot female actresses who played assassin but i have never see any women portrayed like adrianne palicki bad ass she even played lady jaye gi joe teams covert operations specialist movie gi joe retaliation 2013 one my favorite movies fight sequence between john wick viggo tarasov real very realistic i did not see any cgi wouldnt action movie without some action theres plenty its perfectly done stunts completely insane scale there lot gun play powder even guys reload guns there even daniel bernhardt bloodsport ii matrix reloaded he perfect here fight scenes keanu reeves were well done him first time movie i see willem dafoe been good guy i havent seen him decades playing good guy since platoon 1986 my favorite vietnam war movie,3
John Wick,last thing about movie i want say john wick dog lover i love dogs i love how he avenge puppys death mobsters who killed him than he saved another puppy animal shelter when he wounded he wasnt superhero without any bruises him he wounded keanu reeves did wonderful job better than he did knock knock 2015 i only hope they want screwed up sequel making much better action movie than first,8
John Wick,when sadistic young thugs senselessly attack john wick keanu reevesa brilliantly lethal exassassinthey have no idea theyve messed wrong guy new york city his bulletriddled playground wick embarks merciless rampage hunting down his adversaries skill ruthlessness made him underworld legend main plot rating i am giving movie 1010 because deserves,7
John Wick,keanu reeve john wick hes deadly unstoppable hitman shows john wick short point but so much fun 1 hour 36 minutes running time there never dull moment what may one best action films year,1
John Wick,film starts off quickly never stops doesnt spend too much time backstory development wicks life yet still succeeds so well building up his character within first 20 minutes john wick called out retirement when three robbers break into his home steal his car kill his dog even before action begins though film builds up so much suspense gravity into who john wick resulting satisfying exhilarating moment when his enemies realize hes back game,1
John Wick,while plot may simple straightforward works sufficiently setting up situation where rest greatness can happen stylized awesome fight sequences where john wick goes through dozens dozens kills seeing digital imax really helped boost mood film intense sound design visuals slick fighting choreography screen theres one scene film where john wick assaults his way through club all those elements combined make absolutely incredible sequence witness,1
John Wick,besides john wick his fighting film does set up very interesting world thanks all other little details characters brings there organized system those other side law operating exchanging gold coins while staying bases such continental hotel definitely allows room sequels spinoffs,2
John Wick,still keanu reeves star show best i have seen him quite awhile again story straightforward audiences know what emotional journey expect but keanu displays good amount range his portrayal wick still nice see just like his character states im thinking hes back john wick awesome enjoyable action flick i would recommend rating 810,10
John Wick,lesson learned dont get retired legendary hitman john wicks bad side film same name he goes back into action shooting up bad guys city where seems cops have all simultaneously taken vacation played surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian keanu reeves john wicks style shooting baddies reminiscent my days playing whacamole duck hunt any those arcade games plastic guns wick vengeant superman basis entire movie although he doesnt have clear weakness can exploited like most heroes wick does get into enough trouble audience sincerely worried about him,4
John Wick,if youre planning seeing john wick because you like movies clever meaningful story lines then youre going disappointed if you looking raw well choreographed action machismo then look no further house greyjoys alfie allen stands out villainous russian mafia brat iosef tarasov michael nyqvist girl dragon tattoo plays viggo his mob boss father adrianne palicki willem dafoe ian mcshane dean winters round out strong supporting cast,10
John Wick,overall i enjoyed john wick pure action film doesnt have storyline like matrix speed but visually entertaining simplicity story allowed appreciation action movie manly primitive proves age 50 keanu reeves can still mix up action star,4

Mission: Impossible - Fallout,these just small things tdk film critics rated lower than movie doesnt harbor overall movie not bad its just writing could have been much more indepth maybe its just me after seeing god tier praises critics i expected something better than tdk but dialogues werent even close i guess critics dont care about these small things,4
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,but wait they do care about small things i mean look their rating black panther movie currently 8910 rating 51 reviews rt metacritic 88100 score 55 reviews i wonder what makes movie so special critics 🤔 stunts unpredictable plot twists maybe its because its beautiful cgi effects nah doesnt make sense maybe its because its absorbing original story yeah does make more sense because we dont see everyday black man who tries king fantasy land want rule whole world yeah sounds about unprecedented 8910 rating worthy 👌💯 but put yourself some big directors like christopher nolan position think every film you made got more negative reviews than black panther what do directors need create get praised these critics nowadays black harry potter❓,9
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,worst thing these hypocritical critics overshadowing peoples own judgments their dependent opinions polluted politics mindsets like were not fond pretentious directors we dont like blockbuster movies has bad morals if youre going make blockbuster movie has have family friendly morals good political interests quality film second place when its come politics their opinion essential people who cant form opinion nothing can change those peoples mind other than critics now let me say how does work,3

Mission: Impossible - Fallout,next big movie critics going bash will probably once upon time hollywood 2019 but not kind big bash small bashes like they did dark knight shawshank redemption usual suspectsinterstellar fight club se7eninception these films they dont have family friendly moral code they all look so pretentious their big plot twists prominent cast independent directors but these professional critics dont want promote these kinds films they have say irrelevant things about them criticize so they could look cool audience click bait them but course some point they have keep their reputation maintain too thats why they show love some classic movies like godfather 12 angry men pulp fiction seven samurai when they saw cult classic movie alike theyll eat each other praise film like roma they dont want see depressing movies they talk about importance entertainment movie but after they watch schindlers list they forget all about importance entertainment films made docile unknown directors have always been more convenient them praise if message moral codes right they have praise those movies involve feminism politics like dunkirk 2017 wonder woman get out black panther moonlight if message isnt right those movies just another trash their dump like sucker punch fight club watchmen maybe im wrong maybe they didnt like them because they all looked too pretentious maybe they completely misinterpreted whole message like they misinterpreted blade runner 2001 shining psycho theyve always been inconsistent always will next year theyre probably gonna say baseless things about once upon time hollywood like there too much violence there too much n word there too much blood characters were too cold etc without considering movies content because they dont like prominent materials they must say something out place criticize what they do something like declaring horror movie too scary only thing they have politically overwhelmed subjective opinions their big names they wont support their opinions reasons because its risky approach if random person say exact same things about movie like them nobody would take person seriously we wouldnt even care im not saying they shouldnt criticize big movies just tryna point out their motivation their method criticizing inefficient audience i mean just tell me how can same people rate batman begins 6810 black panther 8910 dont we all have eyes see difference we all just blinded politics some critics made hobby bashing pretentious directors who loves put hisher signature hisher films but unfortunately some people really worship these critics nothing can change those peoples minds their eyes those critics always right no matter what but put yourself those directors position try envision critics panning your movie things they dont understand people believing them blindly they want attention people giving them but still who am i judge right i dont have some kind degree like those guys have youre probably making fun me but theyre critics thats what they do you stupid who you make comment about critics methods idiot internet destroys professional critics assumptions logic 😂😂 you have every right because youre right 😂👌🔥💯,2

The Devil's Advocate,cinematography good because its quite understated thats virtue todays cinema acting while containing pretty lame southern accents still pretty good even keanu dude,9
The Devil's Advocate,sorely forgotten its day script tells very deep original interesting story lots development respect characters delicate pacing headspinning ending movie solely about people their struggles fear takes hold audience through dialogue,10
The Devil's Advocate,think devils advocate woody allen trying his hand horrorthriller succeeding movie never makes you jump but puts you general state discomfort through its atmosphere all memorable supernatural dramas one handles its spectacle discretion grace,9

The Devil's Advocate,alpacinos acting no surprise brilliant ever exuding confidence proficiency clarity always keanu reaves leaves great masterplay his work meeting up acting skills required displaying character wisdom success love perhaps vanity charize theron too puts up play passion its right,7
The Devil's Advocate,but what amused me more than all were great fantastic scriptlines thrown around all very meaningful interesting indeed whole movie got me stunned fixed edge my desk seat but favorite part me has come end where theme movie comes words finds chance clarifying itself one most brilliant ways i one have ever seen possible recommended everybody willing enjoin meaningful story blend excellent plays surely 910,10

The Devil's Advocate,i saw movie back 97 theatre running just week after camerons titanic i remember crowds rushed see titanic almost empty room when movie playing after seeing i thought how unbalanced creativity originality vs big budget blockbusters one side number viewers other side later i realised blockbusters masses interesting movies like one few who can see beyond fx small little girls tears i just kid back then i watched again last night although i knew ending awesome ride ending gave me same shivers fist time if you havent seen one go get if you have watch again never gets old nor boring,10
The Devil's Advocate,one most intensely dark beguiling movies i have seen purpose behind create moral drama about fight between good evil man devils everlasting quest conquer mans soul retrospective there few movies ive seen bring out such strong feelings me specially first hour we follow young couple played reeves theron her first big picture who move new york south when he given job attorney one biggest firms country we see change come kevin he introduced world luxury pleasure his boss devil played old master al pacino,9
The Devil's Advocate,ending brings new unpredictable great twist story i will not give away supporting cast pretty strong specially jeffrey jones who plays senior partner lucifer pacinos firm who first arises suspicion kevinkeanu his mysterious behaviour connie nielsen cristabella extremely hot italian colleague who very symbol temptation nielsen looked even better here than gladiator her performance also more interesting charlize theron displayed her range here first time showing she had great potential become star her mix ethereal beauty acting talent reeves also very good hotshot attorney his looks elevated his macho hero potential al pacino didnt disappoint but his performance here counts one his least spectacular,9
The Devil's Advocate,dark movie elements horror some gore sex thrown good measure i think taylor hackford never did better he gave us something ponder while entertaining scaring us same time film one cant forget910,9
The Devil's Advocate,when kevin lomax keanu reeves very good turn lured new york city work powerful persuasive john milton al pacino one best performances his career world his oyster he has dream job given him because defense lawyer he has never lost case beautiful wife charlize theron headturning performance luxury apartment which his wife nearly drives herself crazy trying decorate,8

The Devil's Advocate,film i have seen time again just keeps getting better music cinematography simply amazing film keeper,10
The Devil's Advocate,devils advocate one those movies you watch first time just see climax then repeated viewing you pick up message humanity sin al pacino plays role satan very powerful believable manner exchange between keanu reeves al pacino towards end film may upset few peoples religious beliefs al pacino satan really makes you think nod your head agreement warningal pacino so convincing he may make some people start questioning their own beliefs keanu reeves his best when confronting satan if he playing poker him end he succumbs vanity all humans do time time i think keanu portrayed stages kevin lomax well he goes small town southern lawyer who never questions why he never loses case big city attorney who hears revelations his mother about his father sees his wife commit suicide end kevin lomax uses one satans lines free will against him excellent film worth seeing again again,9
The Devil's Advocate,movie addresses old question lawyer doing right thing defending criminal however finds novel way presenting its idea kevin lomax keanu reevesis young successful attorney fact so successful we reminded time again movie he has never lost case he takes up case man who accused molesting child thinking he innocent midway through case lomax discovers man fact guilty though he little disturbed he helps secure mans acquittal thus he begins selling his soul devil both figuratively literally,8
6 Underground,title just quote ryan d movie chaos i mean good way i think platforms like netflix so just place people like micheal bay so they can go do their thing so freely there so many talk about actually great crazy action opening sequence right away really weird song choices including internet meme onerun so i liked way mood changes kinda turns into political fight also good about its not stupid american provocative movie not best time i had but definetely different fun,7
6 Underground,so you have had long tough week work its friday you want escape your work life you open bottle wine pour glass put movie you have escaped dire reality 95 film perfect release has action has ryan reynolds based humour will never oscar nominee best picture but hey its friday night you have glass wine your hand you want release week times felt like film numbers but nowadays extremely rare not too so please enjoy film what its action its fun its friday night so enjoy,8
6 Underground,these reviewers who watch michael bay movie review if they were expecting shakespeare need stop reviewing seriously only reason watch his flicks so you can leave your brain door turn off lights turn up surround sound 100 sit back watch hit blow up you want thinking persons movie go see something else you want your brain mushed then watch awesome funny action filled fast cars explosions i blowing bubbles out my ears such fun,8
6 Underground,typical modern michael bay film its all style over substance leave your brain door you might enjoy i wish i did but i didnt,5
6 Underground,ill give you quick example what expect while trying explain why i couldnt bring myself enjoy film opening scene 15 minute car chase through city firstly vehicle they choose use getaway vehicle bright neon green alfa romeo sticks out crowd like sore thumb driving bright neon green sports car would why would anyone choose getaway vehicle instead car paint job bit more inconspicuous i hear you ask because its michael bay film thats why its all about style remember secondly every car bike crashes during chase produces enough sparks fire rival opening ceremony beijing olympics plus sounds they make when they crash most ridiculous transformers sounding noises i have ever heard outside transformers movie lastly bright neon green sports car gets scratched up another vehicle drivers side mirror gets knocked off but next shot its back again then its off then its switches between broken not broken dozen so times before someone decided continuity sake we better just stick one other thankfully they chose go broken one pretty sloppy filmmaking really all opening 15 20 minutes unfortunately i cant turn my brain off enough enjoy film like,3
6 Underground,other things i didnt like about film overall story laughable makes absolutely no sense all when i say no sense im not being hyperbolic i mean makes no sense people he chooses join his team way he recruits them missions they do its all so ludicrous if you allow yourself question its logic even one second then entire thing falls apart its got your typical michael bay hit miss humor along other bayerisms weve come expect him like over use quick cuts during action sequences low angle shots women short skirts so much slow motion if slow motion parts were normal speed i reckon film would about half hour shorter than scenes meant emotional pull your heart strings but because every character has no depth them they end up having about much emotional impact carpet cleaning commercial does,3
6 Underground,what i did like cgi people getting hit cars caught explosions thrown around stuff completely overused but first few times happened looked quite good especially people getting side swiped vehicles some bad guy kills were well done i enjoyed most banter between ryan reynolds non ryan reynolds actors funny just ryan reynolds being your typical ryan reynolds which good if you like ryan reynolds i like ryan reynolds who doesnt like ryan reynolds hugh jackman thats who canadian fraud,2
6 Underground,really just film full loud noises bright colors explosions little anything else,2
6 Underground,just mess film editing confusing abrupt story often incomprehensible filled explosions car chases gross deaths attempt buy credit scenes people affected tyrant ryan reynolds only reason i watched movie he not enough redeem,1
6 Underground,after michael bays 13 hours i hoping would another film his would done well yet instead film riddled annoying scene cuts seem out place irrelevant feels like its all over place i can imagine alot positive reviews strong fandoms ryan reynolds but honestly hard watch i get its michael bays typical car chase car explosions but i hoping story would least have coherent flow despite his attempted take form fast furiousesque film,1
6 Underground,i dont unterstand how movie like can released without propper editing worst cuts ive seen big picture like so many flaws eye capturing mistakes makes me wonder if there person actual vision set whole movie felt like michael bays daydreams just one explosion after another packed bad jokes zero effort story telling if you appreciate decent movies decent story telling id wonder if you can sit through waste money,8
6 Underground,why some guys sat around af table let put all stuff needs action scene every scene what do we need cars guns helicopters slowmotion parkour no reason hot women shaky cams stupid one linersmotorcycles explosions lets pay lot product placement,1
6 Underground,now i am quite able leave my brain door enjoy daft action movie provided one central premise film makes sense meaning particular mess film entire purpose protagonists eg killing really bad guys has consistent but when they then proceed inadvertently kill dozens innocents opening scene alone no amount switching off your brain can compensate absolute lack any logic story thats whole point film its people who truly dont need any sense logic barely coherent plot enjoy film just plenty action scenes car chases explosions bad guys naked hot women etc thrown together form collection micheal bays wet daydreams i wont attempt further analyse criticise movie would without merit if youre one aforementioned people then youll probably enjoy however if you need some semblance logic coherent storytelling youll have try very hard enjoy film,1
6 Underground,not sure how movie so many actions scenes can so boring just noisy busy pointless mess no real plot,4
6 Underground,its good mix action comedy first 15 minutes will blow your mind special effects like no other,9
6 Underground,short worst thing you will find netflix thats quite feat giving embarrassly low standard netflix production,2
6 Underground,bad worse what happens when bay gets free creative rein production its just not packed loads unlogical action sequenses its also packed brink so many product placements its gets awkward,9
6 Underground,not even tired ryan reynolds doing his typical ryan reynolds thing can save,8
6 Underground,no you better scip one,2
6 Underground,plot editing all over place too much cgi boring story im writing right after watching movie i dont know what i watched i already forgot awful movie dont waste time do something else instead watching crap only good thing bunch nice shots locations unfortunately all nothing,7
6 Underground,cliches poor editing would my brief summary theres some great action pieces but then its followed up lots quick shots different angles no use slow motion sequence out place its like movie made ai heap tropes fed into computer what spits out you could give film school class say what would you fix how would keep them busy whole semester but i reckon they could come up great product end unfortunately before photo,3
6 Underground,its action movie action stuff its not deep movie complicated one just watch when you want chill couch dont want focus much i hope they do second one because sometimes movies like can great,1
6 Underground,michael bays 6 underground has every single crash bang wallop any desensitised moviegoer could possibly ask everything about film vicious assault senses akin dday invasion normandy i swear every noise universe movie,2
6 Underground,expensive advert alfa romeo 6 underground barely movie despite strong opening sequence film completely riddled all typical trademarks classically trashy michael bay picture complete gratuitous violence loud explosions choppy editing disastrous dialogue threadbare story,8
6 Underground,before you say anything i know exactly what i expect bay his brainless movies his projects not hard enjoy if you leave your brain door before watching however there something so off about something so deeply vulgar crass i just couldnt enjoy even when i did switch off,1
Schindler's List,i have only ever seen film once i only ever want see film once i will only ever need see film once etched my mind i like many others left silence i could not imagine inventing critical analysis film picking small points detail style even scoring points off director stands alone monumental piece cinema magnificent accomplishment,10
Schindler's List,schindlers list undoubtedly best holocaust film ever made there just isnt anything like film various other films have tried show true horrors holocaust but none them succeeded way schindlers list did schindlers list difficult film watch when you see true atrocities holocaust your jaw drops when you see pain all innocent people were going through only thing you can do cry true goal all holocaust films make you feel sorrowful schindlers list did me if you want see best depiction holocaust make your way towards schindlers list me n my kids cried during pit scene,10

Schindler's List,movieschindler greedy german businessmanthen he becomes unlikely humanitarian amid his exposure barbaric nazi reign when he feels compelled turn his factory into refuge jews based true storyhe managed save about 1100 jews being gassed auschwitz concentration camp,10
Schindler's List,steven spielberg rose occasion directing material making sure people do realize horrors jews have gone through during holocaustit simply masterpiecethe use black white simply simply touches color like girl dress light candle provided what powerful emotions viewer,10
Schindler's List,evidentlythe screenplay sharply written movie authentic sincere its presentationthe story simply moving uplifting when goodness men were shown just disturbing horrifying when graphic violence cruelties men towards others were displayed,9
Schindler's List,performances actorsactresses were simply fantasticneeson excellent schindlerkingsley fantastic stern most allfiennes real horrifying like goethethe cast werent over thetop nor were they created like movie charactersbut they were treated film like human beings both positive negative traits,10
Schindler's List,finallyi could honestly say one greatest films ever made could rival godfatherthis truly masterpiece,10
Schindler's List,ive seen film one time 1994 one best movies ever made but many scenes film so brutal im afraid see film second time,10
Schindler's List,film tells story nazi officer oskar schindler who secretly saved hundreds jewish people concentration camps,10
Schindler's List,i have wanted watch schindlers list years but could not bring myself do so because i dont want disappointed schindlers list phenomenally powerful effective portraying historical atrocities i believe no one can keep their eyes dry schindlers list scene involving mothers running after trucks children particularly memorable final farewell scene very emotional me rare achievement but schindlers list three hour film feels too short,9
Schindler's List,movie sensational piece art along being informational told people about holocaust also told people about human spirit shows how people can just triumph over anything just some help one person things spielberg did movie incredible too black white genius how he had little girl red fire phenuminal i have never seen anything like schindlers list beyond all words,10
Schindler's List,movie schindlers list handsdown without doubt one greatest films i have ever had pleasure viewing regardless how much praise i include my review i should still think deserves more few movies actually able pull tears out my stubborn eyes two come right mind one its wonderful life schindlers list grim portrayal events holocaust while same time actually bringing light some humanity still there i embarrassed when i actually started clapping classroom where i first watched movie id recommend anybody remains my top selection movies outstanding,10
Schindler's List,movie started out pretty innocently first 20 minutes i wondering where movie going then started happen horrible cruelty concentration camps oskar schindler example man no matter what situation there people who wont go along cruelty society im sure took courage do what he did because one wrong move youll dead,10
Schindler's List,movie brought life great man who really shouldnt forgotten thanks steven spielberg i think hell remembered generations come movie like should made once while not movie should used evangelistic purposes but some story should told well movie still best vehicle do so,10
Schindler's List,i still think oskar shindlers last words movie one best dialog movie history why did i keep badge i could have saved person why did i keep car i could have saved five more people,10
Schindler's List,perfect,10
Platoon,platoon 1986 american war film written directed oliver stone one most strongest realistic anti war films all time one best vietnam war films i have ever seen won academy award best picture 1986 best director oliver stone well best sound mixing best film editing stones vietnam film portrayed real life human been his point view story telling went his real life he experienced after his tour duty vietnam ended 1968 oliver stone wrote screenplay called break semiautobiographical account detailing his experiences life he vietnam characters were portrayed more then few soldiers they were portrayed more human been than been soldiers obeying orderplatoon shows vietnam war big mistake but being fictional documentary vietnam far its purpose one my personal favorite war movies i love movie death,10
Platoon,those us who did make have obligation build again teach others what we know try whats left our lives find goodness meaning life,10
Platoon,platoon chris taylor charlie sheen young naive us soldier who upon his arrival vietnam quickly discovers he must do battle not only viet cong but also gnawing fear physical exhaustion intense anger growing within him while his two commanding officers draw fine line between war they wage against enemy one they fight each other conflict chaos hatred permeate taylor suffocating his realities numbing his feelings mans highest value life,10
Platoon,chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves each aligned one two men sgt elias willem dafoe sgt barnes tom berenger those two soldiers really two positive good things see film because sets viewer seat edge they both have nominally same enemy viet cong but really doesnt take long realize elias good barnes evil enemy does not enter into moral equation film all its outside threat same malariacarrying mosquitoes even friendly fire elias feels futility war has respect life barnes fights war doggedly has no compassion period both efficient soldiers fighting same enemy but really one point aptly put chris taylor himselfthey fighting souls platoon members outcome war never really doubt,9
Platoon,platoon reaches village where food weapons cache discovered while questioning village chief barnes loses his patience senselessly kills mans wife despite his denials they aiding viet cong barnes about murder mans young daughter force him tell them where enemy,10
Platoon,elias doesnt take kindly kind behavior elias barnes come closer closer open conflict taylor becomes veteran obviously siding elias meanwhile fate platoon comes closer closer them culminating explosively shot action conclusion end dark but morally satisfying,9
Platoon,platoon legendary film film i will always cherish film i will never get tired last vietnam film worth damn watch there isnt any war film today filmed really human drama war today 2015 respectively represents very essence purposefully haunting powerful cinematography history representing admirable cinematic craftsmanship storytelling film sometimes impossible watch its frighteningly intense emotionally draining account vietnam war waged both battlefields within very souls men,10
Platoon,best real human drama portrayed screen antiwar film vietnam 80s my favorite film i will always love death see i also dont watch film action i actually see war how everything what more valuable life film also have message actors portraying characters did make believable performance real team squad soldier fighting enemy viet cong,10
Platoon,battles vietcong shown realistic mostly end final battle 1010,10
Platoon,platoon landmark definition war film pulsepounding sequences stacked wellperformed portrayal soldiers sheen berenger dafoe well couple heartwrenching scenes would somewhat difficult view film oliver stones most significant date especially since its based off his own personal experience vietnam war,10
Platoon,why i think platoon probably best war movie hollywood ever made because its very humane i mean director sees all his characters victims war rather than heroes villains have closer look em,9
Platoon,taylor has no power inside himself torn between two fathers he ends up physical act revenge not what one father taught him other father actually murdered him,9
Platoon,sgt barnes would never fit postwar life knew damn too well himself after all he not fool although might seem senseless killing machine first sight vietnamese bullets could not kill him his talent survival being his enemy so he attempts kinda suicide twice least begging others kill him thus end pain tearing him inside first potheads bunker scene after taylors accusations then when taylor finds him final scene,8
Platoon,sgt elias far too good survive nam maybe even challenged annoyed lifers purpose waiting some bob barnes hit back its pity stone excluded stars scene monologue which explains pretty much about elias ways view future fact himself he sees no future not world all about betrayal killing,8
Platoon,bunny junior one embodiment somewhat sadistic bravery other cowardice their deaths partly morality partly show does not matter if youre black white brave cowardly war makes no difference wiping off everyone can,8
Platoon,king big harold francis survivors yet victims too what awaiting them real world where nobody understands nobody respects anything they dreaming comeback music girlfriends fun time but reality bites who knows will they find their spot under sun will forced use skills obtained nam get engaged crime drug abuse,8
Platoon,red oneill talking about his ability predict if guy gonna make not reflection his own fears shall i stay alive get out here not odds he not stone nails him place captains order take over what once platoon bye patsy,8
Platoon,idea stone has been trying bring forward us not my mind story struggle between good bad possession taylors soul remember boy became murderer end but where war there can no escape leave hope everyone who enters,9
Platoon,highest rate ever,8
Platoon,platoon generally regarded one strongest antiwar films all time while certainly true whats often overlooked least after only one run through film its chiefly tale god vs satan war there set perilous backdrop no doubt platoon shows vietnam war big mistake but being fictional documentary vietnam far its purpose,7
Platoon,story told point view chris taylor solidly played charlie sheen middle class kid who goes vietnam do what he thinks his patriotic duty first ten minutes chris shown uncomfortable jungle struggling just survive natural environment let alone do any actual damage enemy quickly were introduced wellknown facets vietnam war lack sense purpose wraithlike enemies obvious prevalence uneducated poor among fighting grunts soon we see how these factors combine cause widespread low morale some actions more than questionable ethical value,9
Platoon,chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves each aligned one two men sgt elias willem dafoe sgt barnes tom berenger these two really driving force behind film they both have nominally same enemy viet cong but really doesnt take long realize elias good barnes evil enemy does not enter into moral equation film all its outside threat same malariacarrying mosquitoes even friendly fire i wont deny very blackvesuswhite relationship but polarity does not feel contrived elias feels futility war has respect life barnes fights war doggedly has no compassion period both efficient soldiers fighting same enemy but really one point aptly put chris taylor himself they fighting souls platoon members outcome war never really doubt,6
Platoon,eliasbarnes hold platoon viewer developed through several war sequences chilling scene takes place village where our soldiers find no vc but they do find cache vc weapons inhumanity certain soldiers including sgt barnes unflinchingly shown here leaves viewer empty feeling hard shake reminding similarly empty look womans face after she sees her son killed front her,10
Top Gun,i cant believe reviews i have read about top gun being technically inaccurate not enough character development overall simple childish plot gimme freegin break film made look cool sound cool define cool yeah okay mig28s really f5 tigers ive read goofs section before tom cruises height about maverick going supersonic ill there 30 seconds laws physics preventing him covering 200 so miles carrier time whatever so what if top gun had tried accurate truetolife every respect would have been some ohsoserious flick like courage under fire heres some examples what i mean,9
Top Gun,1 whats best way evade cannon fire do snazzy barrel roll problem solved,7
Top Gun,2 mig pilots have tinted visors good guys dont go figure,9
Top Gun,25 russian planes actually grey green mig 28s black tomcats yeah you guessed white good vs evil,10
Top Gun,3 modern airtoair combat usually fought distances tens miles between aircraft top gun uses much cooler spittingdistance wwi era tactics,6
Top Gun,4 its too close missiles im switching guns enough said,8
Top Gun,5 generic guy carrying coffee who gets knocked over fuming aircontrol officer we never see him get up classic,9
Top Gun,6 even edited tv version few steps above normalcool youll flying cargo plane edit out hong kong,10
Top Gun,7 way iceman says mayday mavs trouble hes flat spin heading out sea,9
Top Gun,8 graceful way top gun maintained pg rating without using fword once,9
Top Gun,top gun came out 1986 thats 1986 seventeen years ago rocked then rocks now just watch have some fun,2
Top Gun,absolute cheese stick but top gun proves thats not always bad thing movies got everything arrogant prodigy whod out his arse if he wasnt so good sensible uglier best friend love interest although shes bit mess arch nemesis his dumb sidekick few cool high fives catchphrases emotional death scene euphoric victory scene course some unforgettable action scenes what more could any redblooded child eighties ask anyone born around 1980 will remember how everyone doing double high five saying talk me goose kid next them class certainly one my all time favourites,7
Top Gun,if theres ever proof cachet naval aviation those poor air force guys got trio iron eagle flicks went bad horrible whereas navy flyboys got great 1980s classic sure its cheesy corny but makes cheese corn taste pretty damn good cynic might argue its just two hour long navy recruiting ad one worked me two years later i found my ass pensacola sweating through aocs short aviation officer candidate school program immortalized officer gentleman but making pronavy movie filmmakers also got invaluable technical assistance top navy aviators shows,7
Top Gun,starters although movie takes numerous liberties order entertain basic setup which fighter pilots fleet get sent nas miramar aka top gun intensive training 100 accurate navy back during vietnam getting sick losing too many pilots airtoair combat problem they discovered their fighter jocks had been trained purely longrange missile interceptions meaning theyd lost their dogfighting skills vietnam several american planes were accidentally shot down their own side missiles so safety factor enemy planes had visually identified meaning american pilots were back engaging enemy short range hence need dogfighting top gun school started result rest history,1
Top Gun,now back movie tom cruise maverick hotshot pilot but also somewhat unstable if risky business launched his career movie star then top gun cemented guys wanted like him women course lusted after him plot pure formula but executed consummate professionalism team who put movie together knew exactly how push all right buttons but crème de la crème surely flying i dont think any movie before since has ever rendered air combat more convincing dramatic fashion nearly 100 years fighter pilots have been modern equivalent olden knights men who brought sense glamour romance deadly art war movie gives them fitting tribute,10

The Irishman,last 5 minutes movie explain everything 2 things,10
The Irishman,1 photo his daughter jimmy these 2 persons these ones he loves most reminds him how he lost them both frank killed his best friend he lost his daughter after she understood he did,10
The Irishman,2 door half open 1 minute before end jimmy used let door his bedroom open because he trusted frank frank broke trust result he could never talk his daughter again door represent trust show trust must never broken trust even more important than love because without trust there can no real love,8
The Irishman,great movie great actors congratulations mr scorsese,9
The Irishman,when i love movie much i loved irishman i feel torn one hand i want review rave about try convince others see but then other hand i realise doing so could set expectations too high which could then lead some people getting disappointed happens lot horror movies get hyped film festivals then rejected disappointed wide audiences like witch follows hereditary,5
The Irishman,so leaves me tricky situation ill compromise praising film much i can without overhyping whilst also making vague comments wont specific enough ruin what film has offer because yes its scorsese film he has incredibly varied filmography when you break down just what hes made over last halfcentury so youre never going get exactly what youd expect,6
The Irishman,okay acting phenomenal besides goodfellas pescis best performance ever best de niros been since cape fear best al pacino has been least three decades these men old all accomplished wealthy enough retire happily point but thankfully they all agreed not only star movie but commit themselves 100 no ones phoning here while supporting cast uniformly solid these three steal show i hope all get oscar nominations come awards season,6
The Irishman,scorsese no ones surprise directs brilliantly throughout making every scene purposeful captivating movie long but deservedly so various payoffs towards films conclusion would not hit nearly hard if film didnt spend so long building character suspense emotion,6
The Irishman,crude might sound movie about halfway point made me forget how badly i needed use theatres restroom certain point i accepted i couldnt miss second leaving room even moment totally out question,5
The Irishman,if you can see cinema can handle three half hours without toilet snack break no intermission then all means watch big screen because its beautiful ultimately best way experience film scope spectacle but itll netflix soon perhaps some would prefer watch comfort their own home where snacktoilet breaks possible,10
The Irishman,whatever you do make sure you ultimately watch films like dont come around too often such perfect swansong talented group i doubt well see these legends together again,6
The Irishman,its bittersweet but if scorseses de niros pacinos pescis farewell crime genre then its amazing note go out,6
The Irishman,i dont know where start one other than thanking netflix being only distributor fund movie so we could see big screen legends take their last big swing set screen smaller than i liked being released streaming site but its better than never seeing,9
The Irishman,its not flawless movie i wouldnt necessarily call masterpiece something new innovative but old genre gangsta flick its easily one best ones out there,6
The Irishman,plot lot like godfather 2 de niros perspective but thats all there more grounded far too subtle compared goodfellas thats good thing considering age lead actors movie but doesnt mean its dull gray dreary because isnt surprisingly humorous has some very serious scenes doesnt shy away giving us blast nostalgia every now then,7
The Irishman,cinematography quite different usual modern movies we accustomed doesnt have overabundance wes anderson symmetric shots roger deakins like wide angle shots film shot very old timey way camera pans edits editing movie great score fitting technical aspects considered isnt innovative something jawdropping but never supposed main focus movie,2
The Irishman,main focus me absolutely acting why wouldnt cast like al pacino robert de niro 1st time screen together since heat joe pesci de niro since goodfellas joe pesci coming out retirement martin scorsese directing all these legends screen together if doesnt get you excited film then im afraid nothing will,9
The Irishman,speaking acting my god do they act robert de niro gives his best performance his older age joaquin phoenix top contender best actor oscar i agreed but after watching irishman everything changed robert de niro basically steals his oscar like gangsta gives best performance year so far old bobby here still giving top notch actors run their money guy 76 years old,3
The Irishman,when last time you saw al pacino give really good performance well thats exactly what he does here feels so good see him find his glory days he his usual shouty self but shines better when he tones down let expressions speak,8
The Irishman,boy have i missed joe pesci over years dont worry hes still intense usual thats weird considering he extremely toned down movie if youre looking violent joe pesci like he goodfellas youll disappointed but if youre looking intimidating pesci huge presence then youre right place,8
The Irishman,harvey keitel movie very short time but he did his job fantastically ray romano surprising standout i cant believe how he kept up same plane some these industry legends he doesnt really have bigger role basically gets lost film progresses but he made most his screentime,6
The Irishman,film 3hours 30 minutes long but never felt long honestly first 2 hours went breeze but 3rd hour unapologetically slow felt bit dragged during final hour felt skipping ahead same time wasnt boring any way but felt couldve been handled better cgi deaging so good after while you get confused how old lead actors actually best deaging tech ive ever seen honestly,1
The Irishman,despite being slow latter end still fantastic film doesnt set out do something different doesnt try set aside herd scorsese did what he does best made movie he wanted make its more last big hurrah these living legends than something out flawless masterpiece will most likely last its kind also last collaboration scorsese these acting legends considering time we might well last scorsese film most definitely last joe pesci appearance movie last good mobster hit genre legends like al pacino de niro so enjoy while you can savor remember movie 10 years now rejoice you were alive witness something truly fantastic irishman farewell most these legends loveletter genre its last its kind went out true mobster style,3
The Irishman,you have absolutely out your mind legitimately think scorcese his best ignore all flaws movie yes i get he made lot great movies his time but isnt one them,2
The Greatest Showman,start off review id like say before i ever watched movie i had opinion going rubbish solely because how blown up movie everywhere i went greatest showman i thought perhaps would mediocre film best blown out proportion craze,8
The Greatest Showman,boy i wrong even beginning movie you thrown straight into extravagance what movie about become what basically story simple man becoming legend showbusiness most flamboyant breathtaken musical movie ive seen soundtrack movie beyond brilliant having been impressed hugh jackmans vocals les miserable i not surprised he pulls out bag movie yet again but zac efron really stood out movie truly surprised me,10
The Greatest Showman,when you finish movie you will have great songs stuck your head you will fully satisfied having finished movie your next plan will likely getting soundtrack reliving magic all over again,10
The Greatest Showman,i have never written movie review but i couldnt let jewel movie slammed cynical critics without saying how much i loved perfect movie our family christmas day dont pay attention professional reviews judge moviegoers who praising movie moving upbeat romantic cant say enough good things about hugh jackman zac efron michelle williams zendaya all so talented go see theater really appreciate how magical movie,8
The Greatest Showman,i love circus i love quality cinema not since billy roses jumbo 1962 has motion picture so successfully combined these two elements i wouldnt surprised if won same awards cecil b demilles greatest show earth 1952 michael gracey skillfully brought together best music choreography cast cinematography visual effects costumes set decoration i have seen recent years all fresh original integrated them into nothing short masterpiece,10
The Greatest Showman,usual critics fail grasp obvious does movie entertain yes does absolutely sure may not match real story many things not based reality but thats point its movie fun musical very well done enjoyableif made up story about john g pigglestack then critics would have nothing complain about i actually likes much better than la la land guess its more upbeat musicals rare breed enjoy them while you can,10
The Greatest Showman,possibly one best films i have ever seen genre start finish i felt there some inaudible invisible metronome setting overall pace film consistent rhythm within many rhythms if makes sense everything about film had perfect timing editing seamless attention detail mind blowing costumes outstanding special effects whoa acting flawless i really cant find anything criticize summarize sentence first class family entertainment,10
The Greatest Showman,has been so long since moviemusical made me feel sohappy movie absolutely fantastic everything incredible toetapping music heartfelt dreamfilled storyline i so immersed movie some point i totally forgot i sitting packed theater christmas night ill even admit i broke cardinal rule actually turned my cell phone download entire soundtrack while still theaterand i only two songs i will also admit i am 42yr old who left theater feeling like little kid again wishing i can twirl my way car without being looked crazy lol ive already seen twice many days i plan seeing tons more until i can own myself definitely movie you have experience theater though so please ignore snubnosed critics go see magical film you wont regret,10
The Greatest Showman,ok so im not movie critic im sure they look things differently than i do i almost hesitated see movie because critic reviews but im glad i went anyway movie insanely good acting original music singing imagination fantastic bravo cast crew michael gracey putting together phenomenally entertaining captivating film dont listen critics see movie soundtrack will repeat my car months,8
The Greatest Showman,i didnt really read much about movie before i wentjust expecting something entertaining,10
The Greatest Showman,what i saw pure geniusso well doneand my top 10 movies i have ever seen performances talents displayed were excellent music dancing seemed never let upbut did right times so story could told,10
The Greatest Showman,hugh jackman zack efron were amazingthe showmanship fantasticthe movie grabbed me immediately never let go i can already tell one very few movies i could watch repeatedly journey takes me movie musicalsthat movie deserves considered instant classic,10
The Greatest Showman,i have watched film approximately twenty more times no way exaggeration i may lowcalling sometimes i just have background while i work out morning while getting ready work i play while cooking evening,10
The Greatest Showman,couple occasions ive even caught my boyfriend humming tunes say songs stick you understatement,7
The Greatest Showman,fact weve listened watched so much every 20th century fox movie opening sequence any all other subsequent 20th century fox movies weve watched i automatically think one i am half expecting see hear ah ah ahhh ahh hugh jackman his low ladies gents besides having catchy moving soundtrack film itself wonder look cinematography beautiful costumes welldone again come hugh jackman singing dancing what could better,10
The Greatest Showman,well one not better but almost great rebecca ferguson jenny lind lady gorgeous while she actually doesnt sing her rendition never enough loren allred does passion zeal she brings her onstage performance one books i could literally have replay one scene over over zac efron hugh jackman also have duet which fun witty very creatively done,10
The Greatest Showman,only reason i did not give 10 probably unpopular view i know i will amass hugh not typo number thumbs down but oh well i did not care zendaya all i think she so very miscast i do not think she looked pretty film although after filming i saw her giving couple interviews she looked beautiful i thought she had absolutely zero chemistry zac efron lastly both her acting her voice like chalk grating blackboard me i think logan browning would have been cuter role thats just me though although did affect my thoughts film my score,10
The Greatest Showman,all all watch if you have not yet done so beautiful look modern masterpiece ears,10
The Greatest Showman,evidenced site critical reviews greatest showman have been lackluster best sadly seems unless film features mindnumbing special effects anguished characters andor real thinker ending critical community doesnt feel film worth your time time they got wrong,9
The Greatest Showman,greatest showman uplifting joyous experience we all need now more than ever musical numbers glorious plot while not historically accurate if you want history lesson rent dunkirk heartfelt engrossing film families can enjoy together devoid sappiness goofy grownups infest most family fare greatest present all you feel wonderful end,10
The Greatest Showman,within film entertainment critic who describes mr barnums offerings circus humbug asks whether bothers him all he offers fake barnum referring his customers replies do their smiles look fake no they dont nor do ones theater those smiles reaffirmed through round applause many audiences bestow upon film its conclusion,10
The Greatest Showman,gather family enjoy music leave theater feeling better than when you came happy holidays,10
The Greatest Showman,absolutely beautiful movie visually stunning fantastic acting songs youll keep singing months after songs catchy without being cheesy love choreography well you cant sit still while watching movie story very interesting moving issues they face still relevant today which makes very relatable ive watched three times makes me well up every time my husband well if you havent seen yet go see even if youre not normally into musicals id still give chance,10
The Greatest Showman,now how you do film what epic masterpiece i dont understand critics criticism lack story there very clear cut journey barnums desire accepted then learning what really important life all songs were so catchy more our importantly inspirational they had something say makes me sad see so many missed message very important movie just because wrapped up fun experience cant say enough good things about film its just fantastic our audience clapped end,10
The Greatest Showman,i loved movie i have already preordered blue ray i am planning see movie again theatre i am writing review mainly because i am so annoyed all negative reviews critics one point not completely accurate how p t barnum well musical not documentary still well written story one critic complained movie turned barnum into saint not true he flawed movie times uncaring selfish scenes circus were just amazing choreography very well done songs also excellent performed very talented singers listen songs youtube try never enough greatest showman movie also shows importance having compassion those who different effects racism standing up racism songs very catchy will stay your head movie uplifting movie hugh jackmans dream took 75 years make each actor held their own fit well into their role movie has so much talent effort put into deserves become classic,8

The Lighthouse,lighthouse cowritten his brother,9
The Lighthouse,very loosely based smalls lighthouse tragedy 1801 bizarre film just about every way its glorious visual aural design its grandiose acting its jet black humour its wonderful ambiguity its avenging angelsseagulls if you thought vvitch somewhat inaccessible then youll most likely despise every second lighthouse however if you favour cerebral difficulttodefine always slightly offcamera terror foundational principle vvitch films such,8

The Lighthouse,then youll find much here appreciate,6
The Lighthouse,late 1890s ephraim winslow,6
The Lighthouse,thomas wake,10
The Lighthouse,arrive outcropping off coast new england begin their fourweek rotation manning lighthouse more experienced wake assigns winslow menial tasks such cleaning floors emptying chamber pots oiling gears basement etc whilst he himself attends fresnel lens telling winslow he never ever approach although winslow has some unnerving dreams being pestered oneeyed seagull four weeks pass without too much incident however night before their relief due wind suddenly changes island hit violent storm following morning their ferry doesnt arrive no way contacting mainland duo find themselves trapped,3
The Lighthouse,first thing jumps out you lighthouse aesthetic importance,3
The Lighthouse,s incredible sound design indicated immediately before we see anything we hear wind blowing foghorn rumbling distance horn omnipresent throughout film say gets under your skin understatement you know siren silent hill games sounds right before town transitions real world otherworld well imagine sound bellowing out every minute so entire film its unsettling its disturbing makes impossible ever really acclimate yourself strange milieu theres only one sequence which we dont hear foghorn pivotal opening scene third act silence oppressive its one those instances where you dont realise how loud something until suddenly goes quiet youre left ringing your ears,1
The Lighthouse,sound design matched stunning monochrome visuals working cinematographer,3
The Lighthouse,who also photographed vvitch eggers shot lighthouse 35mm black white celluloid relatively unheard format 1191 ratio transitional format only used briefly during shift silent cinema sound 19261932 thats exactly why eggers blaschke chose yes they do match form content insofar nearly square format traps characters within frame beyond however folktale fable bygone age so what better way present fable than replicating way film would have looked had been made during early years sound filmmaking same time although shot modern cameras blaschke used periodspecific baltar lenses offcyan filter more accurately emulate look late 19thcentury photography taken together black white images square frame lens design patina haunting sound design all work glorious tandem create sense film disturbing artefact antique vestige different era into whose very dna dread has burrowed,10
The Lighthouse,one also has praise,9
The Lighthouse,s production design lighthouse used film wasnt existing structure but custombuilt scale cape forchu outcropping off coast nova scotia however youd never know most interiors were shot soundstages but all exteriors were shot forchu lathrop has imbued every inch building both inside out existentialist dread industrial hell gears basement almost eden like peace lantern room high above cramped crude bedroom squalid kitchen malevolence stalks every nook cranny,4
The Lighthouse,eggers also does something interesting narrative itself ive seen some critics refer winslow wake unreliable narrators whilst such critics right track call characters narrators strict narratological terms inaccurate both characters fact focalisers world filtered through their perspective but they dont narrate indeed although we shift one character other meaning there narrative presence extradigetic level eggers never leaves their perspective nor does he present any kind omniscient overt heterodiegetic narration were imprisoned within their perspective duration film also important here use fallible focalisation story one madness its abundantly clear neither man reliable witness so everything filtered through their perspective ie whole film could tainted unreliable which why critics erroneously refer them unreliable narrators things begin fall apart sense becomes ever more prevalent example important scene near end we see wake do something next scene when winslow confronts him about confused wake points out actually winslow who did wake lying winslow projecting his own actions onto his companion who exactly misleading who here its wonderful use defamiliarising technique which works keep audience constantly edge constantly secondguessing everything they see insofar we know some none all could figment failing mind,10
The Lighthouse,films storyline slight enough suggest several themes without really going too heavily into any them example one could certainly read winslow wakes relationship homoerotic maybe study suppression desire whilst societal construct masculinity particularly manifested competitiveness never far surface another reading would film allegory class struggle á la,2
The Lighthouse,s high rise 1975 lantern room high above upper class wake doggedly protecting room meanwhile bowels lighthouse working class winslow performing menial tasks assigned him wake alcoholism also omnipresent duo progressively drinking more more each night until they run out rum so try mix turpentine honey so dependent have they become numbing effects drink,8
The Lighthouse,lighthouse definitely isnt everyone challenging rewarding equal measure personally i loved every crazy minute theres lot has gone into making film what both terms crafting folkloric story more mechanical sense putting finished film together its aesthetic marvel pretty much every way thick mood atmosphere lighthouse proves vvitch no fluke,3
The Lighthouse,masterpiece explanation no spoilers lighthouse combines mythology mood tell story about people who dont understand themselves like fire prometheus nabbed gods light top tower represents everything all knowledge looking into thomas understood everything all once,6
The Lighthouse,robert eggers second feature superb piece mindbending cinema there parallels his earlier film witch elements psychological horror which eggers clearly finds interesting hopefully hasnt finished exploring just yet decision film black white stroke genius every scene filled ominous portent obscuring shadows film plays our perceptions moods throughout there moments comedy amongst gloom two men stranded rock endure tumultuous relationship turns suspicious angry even savage then there unexpected moments comradeship fuelled alcohol we forced question constantly who mad perhaps madder they grip storm they hell soundtrack no one i can think uses sound create atmosphere quite like eggers foghorns relentlessly howling wind seagulls any wonder if they were mad box frogs willem dafoe absolutely fantastic lighthouse he really should considered oscar his turn saltiest old seadogs spouting ragefilled melvilleesque invective straight davey jones locker sporadic intervals i dont think there many actors who couldve pulled off performance such aplomb he chews scenery mercilessly but exactly what role requires his thomas wake force nature human form lighthouse wont everyones taste would mistake view moody twin sister witch which genuine horror but i found mesmerising intriguing fabulously wellcrafted psychological drama trimmings horror,10
Bad Boys for Life,one those sequels which we did not need bunch endless shooting unnecessary chases senseless action all there movie acting boring writing horrible story even worse heartbreaking see movie has rating 7 insult cinema save your time money stay away bad boys life,1
Bad Boys for Life,plot very predictable even though there load mistakes when referencing earlier movies,1

Bad Boys for Life,rather than just having two lead characters theyve brought team them work which takes emphasis them its like cop version blade trinity,4
Bad Boys for Life,terrible movie script horrible numerous goofs did they get paid not even entertaining no actingjust fooling around plot copied predictable im nauseated,1
Bad Boys for Life,i never thought i would say thisbut i wish michael bay had directed maybe earlier entries hold something dear his heart he wouldnt have allowed go off rails,1
Bad Boys for Life,biggest casualty riffing between lawrence smith which practically rips soul right out franchise laughs first two movies came strong chemistry between two leads how they could argue middle gun fights car chases etc here they just sound like old married couple who have grown tired each other,1
Bad Boys for Life,other casualty action scenes great sam peckinpah once said violence his films he wanted audience feel impact getting shot modern day use cgi such does exact opposite feels more like youre watching somebody else play video game while some praise visuals i criticize its effect pushing viewer further away rather than drawing them,1
Bad Boys for Life,could have been like lethal weapon iv had some fun its theme loose cannon dealing aging instead its more like beverly hills cop iii becomes sad entry otherwise solid franchise,1
Bad Boys for Life,i love these films nowhere close 1st two doesnt even feel like bbs movie its sluggish unfunny tv movie feel about chemistry between will smith martin lawrence not there nearly every joke flat feels like its trying real hard original cast just looks tired most scenes feels its darker movie drowns despair large part film smith lawrence dont have comedy sparring old balance out believe me not 10 its barely 4 me its bbs 1 2 thats when ended sadly,1

Bad Boys for Life,wow martin lawrenceat one point set crew thought they were going have call paramedics because lawrence having trouble inhaling pizza hes so fat now he jumped air action scene got stuck im seriouson runningaction scenes you wont see lawrence more than 5 seconds straight most likely due being out breath i think he took cypress hill lyric fat boy diet dont try extremes one point when lawrence walking away wooden floor sounded like orchestra squeaky nails groaning floorboards playing him out room,2
Bad Boys for Life,back plotlawrence whines throughout movie about promise he made god seemed unlikely than rather nonreligious nonchurchgoer like lawrence would risking losing his friendship his friends life because he danger based some mumbling he did while buddy hospital course lawrence broke his promise god end anyway because he did mr miyagi no fighting no fighting no fightingok go ahead fight predictably went back into action again so dumb,9

Bad Boys for Life,movie filled oneliners dont land crying religion lawrence numerous im gonna kill you after i say one thing then person gets shot behind type thing if smiths lawrences enemies had simply cut chitchat pair would have been dead many points,8

Blade Runner 2049,good greatest thing about sequel simply story without delving into spoiler territory blade runner 2049 concludes ending works internal logical sense yet still surprises there so many good decisions throughout production one could hardly list them all,10
Blade Runner 2049,idea keeping cold war old iconic brands first movie works brilliantly overall look feel movie timeless blade runner 2049 does not try pigeonhole its narrative into concerns today does not wink fears todays audience its own selfcontained universe telling story will work fifty years now would have worked just strongly fifty years ago,5
Blade Runner 2049,acting strong across board harrison ford appearing if he actually wants film looking fit boot also ana de armas needs every movie moving forward truly starmaking turn,6
Blade Runner 2049,bad combination long running time leisurely pace soundtrack health spa can put one catatonic state if one not careful i confess strong ending brought me back into film losing me while there,2

A Nice Girl Like You,i downloaded comedy movie thinking would funny its dumb unfunny girl meets facts life writing so over top unfunny extremely uncomfortable watch outrageous sex jokes didnt work not one them did anybody watch dailies realize nothing working zero chemistry zero sexy zero funny i cringe during most movie how can you make bomb like not one funny scene,1
A Nice Girl Like You,director writer should embarrassed have their name picture ive never given 1 imdb before but movie took hour half my life i will never get back,2
A Nice Girl Like You,started well funny interesting but then 5 min later went down hill girl nice funny good looking guy not really too mature her theres no chemistry between them whatsoever plot totally unrealistic plain stupid,1
A Nice Girl Like You,film made people who obviously have no experience knowledge human reproductive process like homeschooled religious fanatics who think any sort sex sinor hollywood writers who do nothing but watch movies same crowd desperatelybored housewives who made 50 shades gray bestseller women who have no idea what orgasm think sex just another commodity you can pick up big box store use some sort miracle gadget do all work you like one those scam exercise machines,2
A Nice Girl Like You,made frustrated women who cant actually come right out tell their partner what they looking bed much i know you wont learn thing about sex strip club except what pathetic losers consider normal behavior we all have everything we need do already its free doesnt matter what you look like ugly people capable great sex too spite what hollywood would have you believe,3
A Nice Girl Like You,billed comedy but unless cringe now synonym laugh they may have put wrong category,9
A Nice Girl Like You,just me anyone else over whole sexy accent thing american tv movies which male leads have have british australian accent considered hot news flash brits aussie men total slobs just like we,2
A Nice Girl Like You,sad attempt sexy funny story neither sexy nor funny,1
A Nice Girl Like You,going my first ever review i just had share my thoughts film when i saw trailer i thought would fun film watch i am not very picky person when comes comedies i couldnt more wrong about film wasnt funny all i felt like entire film so much like hallmark films pg friendly characters but then there sex subject doesnt get any spicy scenes wasnt either proper predictable romantic hallmark film you would watch christmas about two people falling love nor sexy comedy dirty jokes funny scenes i am fan lucy hale why i watched unfortunately me whole story cringe fest if you consider watching film think hallmark film super pg friendly love story which meets somewhat not spicy sex comedy where no sex scenes anything funny i cant even pick one thing i liked about film really disappointing,1
A Nice Girl Like You,wow absolutely worst just another rehashed romcom has been done so many times makes you sick there nothing remotely original film fact writer has character going s strip club learn about her own sexuality quite simply most farcical thing i have ever seen production company should put back shelf till planet truly point armageddon point we would have nothing lose watching,3
A Nice Girl Like You,i wasnt looking gone wind when i decided download film i found lucy hale adorable role although topic about sex handled smart way wasnt overly raunchy i could watch my teenage children,10
The Wrong Missy,not every movie supossed amarcord casablanca even young frankenstein its not sin enjoy simple movie stop stress fron reality take detour horrible things going todays world youre wathching happy madison production sandlers friends simple plot yes 50 something year old men dating 35 year old woman but i really dont understand hate when i want emotion i see cinema paradiso when i want really scared i see exorcist today i really wanted scape relaxed maybe have one two laughs,7
The Wrong Missy,i disagree those who said shes so cringe hes so flat script non existant latter being truth missy role supossed unnerving moments surprising normality herwell i can honestly say ive met people like annoying good persons almost same time,8
The Wrong Missy,its not great movie but i can honestly say ihad some fun time flew really quick,7
The Wrong Missy,judge some movies what not what suppossed,3
The Wrong Missy,so never meant win oscar lets honest ourselves nobody brain would press play thinking going blow their minds best cinematography acting however did one thing well did very well made me lol throughout movie stupidest simplest things can worth every minute well done one credit due there,8
The Wrong Missy,im generally skeptical these dates anything adam sandlers name attached these days while movie itself has its shortcomings not least which spade romantic lead has shining light lauren lapkus whose comedic performance superb puts her alongside best comedic actors moment she completely commits everything which means many moments would rendered unfunny less capable hands hit mark exceed i will going out my way watch her future,6
The Wrong Missy,recommendation few friends i gave movie shot after watching entire movie i have concluded i probably will not take their next recommendation,1
The Wrong Missy,i kept hearing first five minutes wrong missy made people laugh much any movie they have seen past few years so i figured i would give five minutes hopefully i would agree about how funny i would least tolerate remaining 90 minutes but didnt happen,1
The Wrong Missy,including first five minutes movie never felt like anything more than complete waste time inexplicably i continued watch whole movie despising entire time hardly cracking smile,9
The Wrong Missy,david spade has been funny enough certain past moments but he not funny here his opportunity elevate sunken material limited so its hard know how much blame he deserves i will say definitively i do not blame lauren lapkus films failure she commits her role admirable enthusiasm never letting up moment kudos her trying her best she clearly has potential different role movie she could very funny,1
The Wrong Missy,im big fan adam sandler let me clear im fan adam sandler person all accounts he genuinely kind humble individual he seems like he would blast hang out,6
The Wrong Missy,however many comedy movies he has made lately have been unwatchably awful they have been lazy broadly uninteresting bafflingly stupid thats what wrong missy relentlessly dumb never makes effort even tiniest bit believable,1
The Wrong Missy,if youre fan adam sandler i recommend watching uncut gems its not his typical performance type movie but its wild riveting ride if you mood comedy then try lovebirds both these netflix now,1
The Wrong Missy,names david spade rob schneider were enough get me interested film while its not groundbreaking movie introduced elements made me cringe laugh same time several occasions netflix has certainly delivered one not dull moment beginning end,9
The Wrong Missy,i expecting one worsts movies so far year but surprisingly funny yes some jokes were kinda outdated not good but lot them did make me laugh definitely one best david spade movies i have seen long time so good job him script pretty predictable but overall alright movie,7
The Wrong Missy,i dont know if i feel more sorry writers actors cant believe movie like could ever made,2
The Wrong Missy,one really bad annoying character difficult watch,1
The Wrong Missy,seems like there so many dramas tv very few comedies had me laughing out loud through most movie its worth 90 minutes your time,7
The Wrong Missy,please dont blame actress train wreck script how did even get made sad women sad adam sandlers aging wolf pack sad screen writers please just stop,1
The Wrong Missy,wrong missy 3 out 5 stars,1
The Wrong Missy,wrong missy fair comedy film filled stupid humor which what you can expect happy madison production comedy movie does have typical predictable story cliches but kind entertaining,1
The Wrong Missy,plot follows tim david spade who had bad blind date when he met melissa lauren lapkus her loud obnoxious weird personality months later he meets another woman melissa molly sims which her personality like his dream woman they swapped numbers went there own ways airport when his company throwing retreat hawaii he decides invite melissa which he gets surprise airport when melissa blind date shows up which she tries take charge every situation she his work party,9
The Wrong Missy,predictable plot which you can tell who going get who before happens tim has enemy work which she hates him always trying better than him front there boss she will conflict tims secret about missy his dream girl melissa tim missy opposites he quiet passive she loud clumsy,2
The Wrong Missy,missy played lauren lapkus entertaining she may act stupid have loud personality sometimes her performance may overboard trying get laughs which may annoying than funny she did decent character david spade molly sims nick swardson even rob schneider did decent performances may not great acting but they all entertaining having fun their characters,1
The Wrong Missy,if you seen previous happy madison production movies adam sandler produced enjoyed than you will enjoy well simple predictable plot actors having fun their characters plenty dumb humor,1
Get Out,hit miss comedy get out jordan peele proves us he has certainly matured filmmaker,8
Get Out,get out one best most refreshingly original horror movies last decade rather than having your face predictable jump scares cheesy music get out dwells mind relies fear unknown while giving subtle messages racism whats like black america antiracism movie everything handled very well due peeles great writing ive already mentioned best aspect get out writing characters intelligent people behave like logical human beings instead cliché horror movie idiots everything happens reason there meaning behind everything also unlike other horror movie clichés get out doesnt fake its scares replaces them needless humour instead humour mainly lil rel howerys character perfectly balanced story shows up adequate times,8
Get Out,creepy unsettling filled brilliant performances primarily daniel kaluuya even better writing get out perfectly represents us society its current era,9
Get Out,final score 810,5
Get Out,get out takes initial premise guess whos coming dinner then twists stepford wives create compelling thoughtful critique white power peele course isnt arguing white people out hypnotise black people instead get out stinging criticism white liberalism carries itself empathetic towards blacks but empathy only extends far white control peele isnt taking aim neo nazis other whites who would angrily shout nword theyre lost cause instead hes looking those who profess their lack racism but only do so if they can maintain their dominance over black people most insidious manner possible chris pointedly notes rose party full white people has anyone here ever met black person didnt work them,5
Get Out,film genuinely creepy instead cheesy music grotesque torture porn peele relies unknown draw you what happening here plot builds like slow boil terror explosion clues outcome evident first second but takes entire runtime pull everything together its such joy surprised horror outcome i dont think ive seen genre film inventive since cabin woods resolve truly satisfying,9
Get Out,my favourite aspect get out intelligence characters theres lot like but beyond deeper themes characters arent morons i cringe every time i watch genre film characters dont behave logically chris rose not fools something amiss enough warrant wariness anyone situation would unnerved events play out credit again peele writing characters act rationally,5
Get Out,get out doesnt replace scares humour – peele too smart do instead he balances fear laughs then laces everything social comment unsettling tone fact chris so eminently likable just underlines all adds up something treat – everybody not just horror fans,2
Get Out,interesting movie about interracial couple who decide go weekend visit girls parents boyfriend chris starts noticing odd behaviors african americans house workers what started fun relaxing weekend slowly turns into living nightmare him,5
Get Out,idea original interesting acting good all but i felt daniel kaluuya not emotional enough his reactions too cold many scenes but generally speaking movie well paced all aspects yet i wont call horror anyway me its no more than psychological suspense thrillerit gets tense but never scary,3
Get Out,movie has its share racism cant go unnoticed but its not too much mainly stereotypical yet i believe concept plot can executed any race which clearly hinted stephen roots final scene open minded audience can go throw enjoy without any care its racism,4
Get Out,i decided see film theater after hearing some hype which basically excellent horror film told perspective black man,1
Get Out,well i can see would truly worst nightmare black man really worst nightmare us all not film tries make viewer feel sorry black people nor all preachy but just good old fashioned horror film fresh new setting im old white guy way,8
Get Out,acting wonderful directing amazing film while mostly horror actually completely hilarious some parts making funniest scariest movie i have seen ages no easy feat shame film will likely not regarded company academy award potential nominees because directing acting honestly oscar worthy again no small feat horror movie also funny,1
Get Out,summary must see theater one best films year fun ride very well done,1
Get Out,cookie cutter suspensethrillerhorror flick isnt very suspenseful thrilling scary only real change norm movie features black man lead actor early movie touches some problems interracial dating black mans perspective i found some humor way white family later their white friends interacted lead charactergoing out their way times either talk about how they voted obama loved tiger woodsbasically doing saying things white people say black people attempt prove they arent racist,4
Get Out,movie fairly well acted despite not having exceptionally strong material work i thought daniel kaluuya turned really strong performance he really saved movie imo i dont recall seeing him anything else prior but he gave excellent performance i hope serves spring board biggerbetter roles seems very talented,10
Get Out,my biggest problem movie i dont know what trying kind hit little bit satire humor elements but all all movie just doesnt really have identity mystery behind everything not well concealed twists turns youd expect movie like just never developed i had movie pretty well figured out before halfway mark which made less enjoyable second half movie im pretty amazed all rave reviews its getting,1
Get Out,bit groundbreaking its own right strictly culturalsocialracial aspect has been largely neglected movies especially genre but once you get passed just look movie what i cant really give movie anything more than middling grade not worst movie ive ever seen any means but also not really worth price admission either wait come out netflix enjoy comfort your own couch,3
Get Out,premise get out interesting makes unusual horror premise although good deteriorates into clichés end never fully fleshing out any characters injecting humour where doesnt really fit opening credits song haunting evocative but film itself portrays characters one dimensional all white characters evil all black characters victim usual americas depiction race there no middle ground only white black no biracial no latino no native american only one asian character randomly thrown,1
Get Out,although film itself fine if not rewatchable what disturbed me most sitting audience black movie goers who cheered deaths all white people made horrible comments,1
Get Out,horror lover i have never seen even worst killer onscreen murder cheered yet audience lapped up because white people were being killed even if they were villains unsettled me im not american so my countries issues race not par americas see audience react way felt odd if i had been transported america i almost feel like film set race relations back ultimately interesting horror but more cheap shot evil ol whitey depths never really explored,2
Get Out,lets clear air about film its not horror film its not comedy what suspenseful thriller highest level worthy compared hitchcock caliber humor there along few horror scenes but not enough overshadow main theme story film hits all cylinders almost no misfires far complaints film racist not would work just well allblack allwhite cast those complaints people who uncomfortable black people interracial relationships letting distract them narrative film i most certainly hope reaches wider audience so richly deserves,1
Get Out,movie received incredible reviews time release so i watched great anticipation however i hugely disappointed nothing more than run mill horror nasty thinly veiled message beneath all white people racists whilst premise interesting played like its either pastiche am dram production hint hammer horror plot has no surprises half way through has become boring,1
The Dark Knight Rises,christopher nolans epic trilogy concludes glorious fashion gives us thought provoking suitably satisfying conclusion epic saga its emotional intense has great villain tom hardy,10
The Dark Knight Rises,after eight years seclusion batman resurfaces face bane mastermind bent destroying gotham has ties bruce waynes past christopher nolans conclusion his dark knight trilogy should treated wrap up rather than third installment despite many new characters being introduced even their conflicts motives derived events occurred previous two films such approach could seen weakness since conflict could just end up being sort rematch rather than moving story forward however nolans approach works terrificly over hour shot stunning imax but film more touching than intense thats its best quality hardy steps genius mercenary bane who slightly bigger slightly stronger slightly smarter than batman thus making him challenge best suited grand finale joker works best batmans archnemesis since they polar opposites joker standing everything batman stands against twoface works best batmans most tragic enemy because harvey dent very much like bruce wayne only difference dent copes his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice wayne did bane works best batmans most challenging villain because his physical mental superiority—forget bane you saw batman robin nolan carefully chose all his villains series wisely executed them perfectly hardy had big shoes fill following ledgers posthumous oscar winning performance while bane no joker hardy does satisfying job should not compared ledgers performance they completely different roles michael caine however delivers most memorable touching performance entire film wonderful conclusion wonderful trilogy,10
The Dark Knight Rises,out four,10
The Dark Knight Rises,wow thats all i can say i freaked out about movie because i loved first two too often have i gotten into series then been horribly disappointed last entry eg hunger games i hated third book being said even though i nervous i still had high expectations exceeded those acting excellent consistently previous movies action good story great characters were diverse interesting despite longevity film wasnt too slow all,9
The Dark Knight Rises,movie emotional roller coaster ending heres where spoilers start extremely sad but ironically really good one thing i nervous about ending would typical superhero movie ending happy because main bad guy dies gets arrested whatever wasnt ask anyone who knows me well im very stoic guy but almost had me tears course could have been fact part came around 3 am my mind wasnt working right,9
The Dark Knight Rises,basically awesome film my sole complaint another spoiler here banes death ill give realistic i expected his death long drawn out sentimental thing but reality his head got blown off flash first i thought stupid but its sorta more realistic considering its superhero movie anyway,10
The Dark Knight Rises,if youre worried will ruin series you dont i loved movie i dont know if its good dark knight but if not its very very close watch do yourself favor,10
The Dark Knight Rises,dark knight rises perfect sequel masterpiece christopher nolan took different direction focused more bruce waynebatman movie filled lots emotions has such great characters course dialogs so good performances incredible my most anticipated movie century more i watch more epic gets personally i think dark knight trilogy greatest trilogy all time movie gives greatest ending all time movie history i remember seeing thrice more i watched more respect earns thank you christopher nolan you sir master,10
The Dark Knight Rises,bane more terrifying nemesis than joker soundtrack hans zimmer booming unforgettable end trilogy,10
The Dark Knight Rises,dark knight rises outstanding end what has been best trilogy i have ever seen,10
The Dark Knight Rises,film me sums up what batman stands belief someone can turn their leaf become better belief fear posses person can destroyed even help person rise what christopher nolan has given us dark knight rises not lazy movie its movie makes audience think because me i had watch film many times until i have fully understand what has happened isnt what makes good movie when we have watch again again again,10
The Dark Knight Rises,lets move acting star man christian bale who again amazes me his portrayal bruce wayne because even though we dont see lot dark knight i personally am okay because i like seeing real bruce wayne dealing problems without batman costume another star man tom hardy bane scary yes intimidating yes witty yes list can go thing tipped we can only see his eyes me he only acting his menacing eyes just captivates any audience anne hathaway catwomen perfect cast she brings zing film shes elegant yet sexy same time which perfect casting perfect casting all round including obviously joseph gordonlevitt blake robin,10
The Dark Knight Rises,dark knight rises give audiences nearly three hours pure excitement me i wanted continue another three hours film so good i had watch next day because had every element what makes good batman film such villain bane because he physical match batman not like other phenomenal batman films which more psychotic villains good love story doesnt bore audience great ending,9
The Dark Knight Rises,overall ultimate ending ultimate trilogy which must watch once again christopher nolan has done something special,7
The Dark Knight Rises,not being huge fan superhero movies i didnt have much expectations batman begins however viewing 2005 christopher nolan production i pleasantly shocked then after my huge expectations dark knight christopher nolan blew my expectations dust will same happen 3rd last film dark knight rises quite simply yes my big expectations were once again blown away what production true cinematic experience behold movie exceeded my expectations terms action entertainment editing sound score visuals direction action all top notch,6
The Dark Knight Rises,film contains fine cast talented actors christian bale course still makes great batman michael cain fantastic he always he gives such powerful performance he really ought considered oscar nomination tom hardy bane utterly terrifying times completely ominous anne hathaway catwomanselina kyle scene stealer she completely engrossing everyone so great dynamic scenes between actors so well done so well written so well directed dark knight rises emotionally riveting amazing view,10
The Dark Knight Rises,running time almost 3 hours film never becomes dull which pretty impressive movies action sequences spectacularly well created very intense dialogue between characters intelligent highly believable movies soundtrack terrific really exemplifys many movies scenes extremely well editing sound use really develop many movies action scenes so its not just explosions visuals like many other movies nolan creates grand dirty engrossing world his action sequences just hum,1
The Dark Knight Rises,conclusion film gorgeous reminder great writing direction can enhance any moviegoing experience even superhero movies which usually thought mindless entertainment i am wholly satisfied christopher nolans vision thank all who worked film bringing such intricate interpretation its very famous literary source i cannot recommend film anymore than i have i just have say everyone anyone should see 1010,1
The Dark Knight Rises,after watching dark knight rises i concluded if there anybody who can make kickass sequels its nolan film contains everything brilliant acting raw action out world oneliners amazing cinematography already very hard make sequel film which just good enough hit but make sequel film which will always remembered best you have do very impeccable job what done movie beginning end you have some very beautiful emotional scenes like mob fight between police thugs rise batman prison chants deshi deshi basura basura towards end where alfred bruce see each other probably last time both know he has made,10
The Dark Knight Rises,dark knight rises capped off what probably best comic book related trilogy movies all time earlier series you had batman begins dark knight just being perfect way finish off series,1
The Dark Knight Rises,since last movie its been 7 years batman has been seclusion since then christian bale returns batmanbruce wayne new villain has emerged being menacing bane played great tom hardy,1
The Dark Knight Rises,supporting cast has returning members like morgan freeman gary oldman michael caine addition new members like josephgordon levitt marion cotillard anne hathaway,2
The Dark Knight Rises,movie has running time about 2 hours 45 minutes but doesnt seem like all movie flows like 2 hour movie,10
The Dark Knight Rises,i cannot imagine batman movie after dark knight rises out without inception director christopher nolan helm warner brothers dc comics got legendary costumeclad crime fighter trilogy right sure you can nitpick but nolans batman movies differed ambiance those both tim burton joel schumacher nolans batman movies trod thin line turning vigilante into hero scrutinizing morality his behavior essentially nolan rebooted franchise recreated bruce wayne batman troubled alteregos turned good versus evil episodes earlier films into fullblown spectacles while sticking slavishly basics he relied his fertile imagination give characters greater depth examine issue vigilantism nolans caped crusader movies dont rely humor much slight offhand comments action unfolds swiftly characters clearly delineated before end credits roll you prepare yourself surprises films replicate haunted quality burton forged his michael keaton forays while schumacher embraced bright heavily saturated slightly surreal comic book quality course batman graphic novels frank miller have influenced nolan christian bales part success trilogy considerable he more michael keaton batman than either val kilmer george clooney crime fighter bale batman same way sean connery bond longtime british actor michael caine makes superb alfred pennyworth but michael gough no slouch himself four previous batman incarnations unquestionably nolan steps back batman caped crime busters zenith ending trilogy capper odd indeed warner brothers conceivably could make another batman movie based nolans conclusion dark knight rises,1
The Dark Knight Rises,anybody who tries top dark knight rises will have lot prove both artistically financially christopher nolan batman movies what james cameron terminator movies stepping into nolans shoes will pose supreme challenge whoever dares nolan approached batman franchise reverence played plots close straight possible shunned clever oneliners dark knight rises surpasses both batman begins origin movie dark knight dark knight rises takes franchise brink annihilation what amounts gotham city armageddon batman contends two worthy opponents played part his origins most obvious villain bane hulking brute man he looks like cross between wrestler equivalent human pit bulldog bane wears contraption over his face enables him handle pain life basically we never see british actor tom hardys face because he conceals mask interestingly imbues bane mystery furthermore bane speaks through contraption he sounds quite avuncular other words he doesnt sound menacing darth vader but he doesnt mince words finally former disney princess anne hathaway makes willowy cat woman just marvel people had trouble getting hulk right dc people have experienced similar trouble getting catwoman right anne hathaway makes perfect catwoman,1

The Firm,firm tom cruise plays extremely intelligent young lawyer who takes job tremendous firm having been seduced their huge financial offerings firm begins sound very creepy very early film when becomes known firm has never had divorce firm encourages children firm big happy 41 member family unfortunately seems another interesting little side note no one has ever left firm lived,9
The Firm,mitch mcdeere cruise hired firm first everything great firm loves him enough pay back all his student loans all once he completely taken everything even down way firm furnished his new house his beautiful new neighborhood make you feel home hope you dont mind lives mitch his wife abby jeanne triplehorn completely drastically changed when he hired firm setting up disorienting atmosphere especially when strange things start happening people getting killed boat bombs whatnot,10
The Firm,gary busey plays small seedy role works really well because hes best playing seedy characters ed harris also delivers good performance fbi agent trying coerce mcdeere into helping them investigate big bad firm seems mcdeere has been helping firm its illegal activities making him guilty without him even knowing about if he doesnt help fbi hell go jail other 40 members big happy family,9
The Firm,firm really gets going once mcdeere starts trying investigate making copies incriminating files etc some things may have gone little too far like conveniently placed pillow truck but whole firm great thriller may not quite good other john grisham adaptations rainmaker particular but firms complex fascinating plot well good direction acting makes way above average,7
The Firm,all elements make hardhitting melodrama corruption fbi mafia aspects present unfolded here gripping yarn john grishams novel tom cruise excellent young man who joins small but prosperous law firm only discover all perks he enjoys come great expense his integrity not mention his life plot thickens when members firm murdered cruise gets drawn into unmasking firm risking his life reveal criminals gene hackman ed harris holly hunter hal holbrook all give strong performances hunter fully deserving her oscar nomination pacing good despite films length well over 2 12 hrs theres seldom dull moment especially gripping supercharged climax,7
The Firm,not having read book i see where others disappointed ending having no comparison make i can only say kept me absorbed until final scene definitely mustsee if you enjoy action thrillers climactic punch one best films 90s full suspenseful twists turns,8
The Firm,i read firm after watching not knowing what expect i didnt know if would tight loose adaptation pretty close difference mainly lying ending where sydney pollack makes story go good great book end makes mitch out coward traitor end making him give into fbi but film mitch seen hero who doesnt give into anyone fbi doesnt win mafia doesnt win mitch wins he bows down no one tom cruise also plays great mitch mcdeere lot intensity charisma you cheer him protagonist holly hunter topnotch her portrayal vulnerable secretary turned accomplice tammy gene hackman also great avery tolar one bad guy who sympathizes mitch abby such great screen presence his scenes while theyre kaymen islands key ones watch jeanne tripplehorn finally makes up her role basic instinct abby mcdeere cheated wife not only her husband but also firm he works sydney pollack showcases some his best work director especially opening segment describes mitch mcdeere perfectly span less than 10 minutes,10
The Firm,such great adaptation even better film watch,8
The Firm,tom cruise all american kid trailer park who worked his way through harvard law school just got dream job prestigious white shoe law firm memphis tennessee sounds like hes his way top wife jeanne tripplehorn but turns out nightmare,5
The Firm,firms main client chicago crime family they launder mobs money now fbi persons fatherly steven hill hardnosed ed harris squeezing cruise infiltrate get incriminating information would result disbarment violating lawyerclient privilege firm isnt gang boy scouts either theyre not above little blackmail entrapment theyve got security man wilford brimley whos real good,8
The Firm,how tom cruise gets out rock hard place situation plot firm sydney pollak gave him one stylish cast support everyone them delivers even players like gary busey hal holbrook gene hackman take essentially supporting roles because film guaranteed blockbuster all john grishams novels have their own built audience firm no exception i do remember my mother devoted reader his work whereas i always await film version,8
The Firm,holly hunter got oscar nomination her small role private detective gary buseys secretary girl friday when hunter witnesses buseys murder without hit men knowing she sets wheels motion downfall bad guys hunter got nominated best actress piano best supporting actress firm most unusual occurrence she won piano 1993 but lost supporting actress award her costar piano anna paquin winning both would have just been bit too much academy voters,7
The Firm,firm has far fetched plot sure way tom cruise brings them all down still thats charm its almost hitchcockian its pace mood even more resembles mission impossible television series way its all brought off small wonder tom cruise chosen star big screen adaptations television classic,10
The Firm,when i watch firm im reminded line another television classic one hannibal smith used say about he loved when plan comes together thats what you will like about firm,8
The Firm,long 154 minutes but pretty solid dramasuspense story about corporate corruption film features wellknown cast soon action kicks becomes very tense story,9
The Firm,tom cruise very good hotshot lawyer jeanne tripplehorn who plays his unhappy wife complex story times one not always easily understood especially ending so much explained so fast end its tough comprehend all,1
The Firm,wilfred brimley gene hackman hal holbrook holly hunter robert strathairn ed harris all make really deep impressive cast more details story check some other reviews,10
The Firm,firm 1993,6
The Firm,twist plot you realize memphis law firm not what seems rather innocent freshman lawyer played tom cruise slow catch core movie relief starts steadily slowly depending your patience fact plays many scenes out more detail than we need kind bookish thriller its not bad ride there some further minor twists but its not packed tightly enough frankly original enough lift its boots out sand,10
The Firm,director sydney pollack hugely successful director actor might have just had bad scriptwriting here david rabe because john grishams book had proved itself acting really solid im no cruise fan but hes fine but characters often doing things just dont quite follow improbable stupid they end up doing something dangerous danger either watered down ridiculous examples come mind how they show cruise discovering stealing xeroxing files we get plot but lumbers along just shown not built up suspense cinematographer takes hit here i think things often nicely framed routinely well done but thriller needs hide some things show some things create ambiance mystery so visually doesnt really happen,9
The Firm,so kind technical highstakes rich persons goodguy badguy suspense film will get you through but barely last five minutes if you arent sucked youll want scream hurry up,6
Moana,like most adults i came view film result having two small children however i very pleasantly surprised film my kids loved,10
Moana,let me start saying original music film outstanding when watching disney you expect good but soundtrack amazing animation film also what youd expect disneysuperb,10
Moana,now far plot goes you have heroine what i feel first real heroine all animated films ive watched most films make forced effort show girls they can also excel whoever they choose moana takes girl whos also princess way but ordinary one allows her truly explore achieve save world not through magic extraordinary power luck but through hard work perseverance she real maui also perfect comic relief rock does excellent job roll,10
Moana,my kids want watch again so do i,9
Moana,i love everything about movie colors setting characters all good my eyes,8
Moana,individual double majoring computer science creative writing focus screenplays i have say moana one best disney movies i have ever watched fact i astonished its storyline along its animations became one my favorite movies ended up buying my own moana doll christmas,10
Moana,spoilers particular i truly enjoyed scenes where moana gained confidence go out there voyage into sea even though her dad tui wanted her focus being chief her people first time she went out didnt end so well i laughing so hard when moanas grandma said whatever she did she blamed pig pua which fact one most adorable characters disney has ever created but i admire confidence she showed confidence showed me we individuals truly individuals,5
Moana,i also loved scene where maui trying turn into hawk when he moana were trying get hook tamatoas shell hilarious see him turn fish shark then chameleon etc then finally back his human form made even funnier when tamatoa saying maui having trouble his look he singing shiny,8
Moana,all all i cant think anything wrong movie one disney movies i can watch over over again,8
Moana,moana return classic disney formula clichés characters ripped number other animated films however pure beauty skill production rises old story into new heights,8
Moana,following success zootropolis moana follows more traditional narrative we know love princess who wishes something more whisked supernatural adventure we know story so well yet moana seems fresh thrilling if plot innovative perhaps due polynesian setting morally ambiguous maui played perfectly dwayne johnson but most likely simple magic disney – wonder both children adults has reached its peak perfection classic formula once clichés make film more enjoyable quality animation helps too its clear they have reached pinnacle blending realistic textures stylised designs creating aesthetic beauty few other companies can match – disney have mastered water point looks better animated than real life even music has been perfected here annoying catchiness frozens tunes replaced memorable but effective songs fit culture setting our adventure childlike warmth awakened me many other adult members audience film brought emotional highs disney renaissance without modern subversion classic tropes while moana sometimes threatens pop culture references film thankfully keeps mostly traditional values morals step above many childrens animated films released today,6
Moana,moana good old fashioned disney magic traditional narrative morals updated stellar animation awareness thats effective but never overpowering enough threaten integrity disney formula,9
Moana,sweet,4
Moana,visit httpssweetorsaltedmoviereviewscom more,7
Moana,wow what great great movie visuals movie breathtaking they so gorgeous but besides visuals there such heart imagination creativity movie moana such likable smart relatable person voice work moana so sweet so good chemistry between moana maui so great so natural songs movie so charming catchy fun but how far ill go such emotional song has such hearti dare say i like little more than let go way moana sings you can feel wow i just looved movie great kids adults i will always love i wanna see again,10
Moana,instant classic,8
Moana,easily ranks among best disney studio very worthy successor mulan 1998 similar story equally well done,10
Moana,oddly also seems best work ever dwayne johnson perhaps not first name i would have associated voice acting but star turn nonetheless,3
Moana,if you want picky which reviewers job after all momentum slows little top third act but ultimate themes redemption forgiveness selfdiscovery finale absolute joy,1
Moana,they used say children all ages,4
Moana,tell me if youve seen movie,2
Moana,princess wants do something parent doesnt want her do close friendrelative inspires her bedo anyway princess meets wacky sidekick prince wacky sidekick dont get along but forced work together princess wacky sidekick bond conflict happens princess wacky sidekick part ways princess continues wacky sidekick shows up out nowhere help princess princess wacky sidekick win become friends forever parent realizes they were wrong encourages princess bedo whatever,7
Moana,i felt like i already knew plot film because i had seen 100 times before why didnt i rate lower because its visually stunning style film very unique i like way they wove samoan artistic sense into i found myself mesmerized water effects animals more than anything else,10
Moana,fun kids but nothing you havent seen before,6
Moana,2016 has been particularly strong year animated films likes zootopia finding dory kubo two strings all vying best animated picture year seems moana deserves mentioned same breath well its no fluke out four movies i just mentioned 3 them belong under house mouse,5
Stand by Me,i find hard comment film without simply repeating what has already been said its not i cant think anything original but others seem have felt exact same emotions i did when watching film,10
Stand by Me,i saw movie when i about 12 13 maybe 14 years old so didnt have same nostalgic sense had so many but what did make me ache those memories i wanted words another reviewer 12 cool i wished i had been like i had had friends like laughed like had adventures like,10
Stand by Me,milkmoney scene probably one my alltime favourite scenes movie history up until i saw movie i had never held much regard river phoenix but poignancy sincerity which river added role chris chambers touched me point tears i read yet another review scene river asked think time when he had been hurt adult even after cameras stopped rolling river sat there still sobbing hurting i felt every tear heard every word though i were there chris,10
Stand by Me,movie made me laugh cry rejoice fear chris gordie teddy vern i loved campfire scenes today i look back my own childhood remember laugh amazingly similar things i used laugh wonder about my friends i remember dreaming about being writer actress i remember standing up bullies i remember walking riding my friends i remember being afraid crying onto friends shoulder,10
Stand by Me,i guess what movie does everyone take them back time even though situations may have been different chances youll find similarities remember smile yes your life once cool words vern great time,10
Stand by Me,i especially loved ending they found out who strong who just talked tough i loved last scene chris gordie closing monologue,10
Stand by Me,i never had any friends later like ones i had when i twelvejesusdoes anyone,10
Stand by Me,film brilliant wellacted masterpiece what touched me most late river phoenixs acting but all young actors performances were incredible they why you should see film stand me not bubblegum disney film nor dry hollywood film movie captures childhood poignant noncandy coated manner dead i saw movie only couple months ago blown away its style acting rare you see such fresh relaxed deep performances actors film offered although not recent film genuine inspiring film so refreshingbeing so different than films hollywood often gives us i give film 100 recommend everyone you will benefit its message its wonderful acting,9
Stand by Me,stand me yet another one stories made into movie author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author history stephen king clearly central character here gordie lachance whose point view story told who obviously symbolizes king himself given many his characteristics well some content film movie literally filled actors who have achieved varying degrees success over years such jerry oconnell who played vern river phoenix who could have been bigger than leonardo dicaprio if he hadnt died corey feldman who has grown into unenviable but visible existence kiefer sutherland who has become excellent very well known actor john cusack can seen small role gordies late brother course richard dreyfuss who played narrator gordie adult has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than decade before stand me filmed original story even written,9
Stand by Me,stand me takes place summer 1959 general time period stephen king most skilled presenting four friends set out find body kid who killed train hoping find what they predicted would astronomical fame unfortunately towns bullies also out find body same reason which leads films ultimate final climax even though very clever story which tell fall innocence story brilliant characterization incredible acting really make classic film extremely rare film comes along stars young kids so moving powerful also every one those kids made three dimensional creative smooth ways making you feel like you really knew them end film vern fat kid who always gets picked teddy chris both have abusive deranged fathers not mention chriss cruel brother gordie young boy who lost his brother three months earlier violent accident who has been largely ignored his parents ever since one memorable scene gordie wonders how teddy can so enthusiastic about his fathers alleged military achievements when man once held his head stove nearly burning his ear off gordie mystified because he could care less about his own father who hadnt laid hand him since he three years old got caught eating bleach under sink,10
Stand by Me,stephen king pokes fun his own craft many times film such gordies vehement line fck writing i dont want writer its stupid waste time not only but there also obvious references his other works such when boys first realize no one brought food teddy says great what we supposed do eat our feet people who actually read instead just lazily watching movies will recognize major part plot another kings short stories survivor type which cast away borrowed heavily why dont you people read these books body which stand me based only 148 pages long you could read couple hours experience totally different movie its even more disturbing body published same book different seasons couple kings other famous stories  apt pupil course rita hayworth shawshank redemption,10
Stand by Me,stand me story how one event can unexpectedly change lives seems story about friends how important they but possible theme clearly dispelled line narration spoken end film  time went we saw less less teddy vern until eventually they became just two more faces halls happens sometimes friends come out your life like busboys restaurant instead film about learning life changing experience actually making changes modifying your life some way because heavily emphasized end film,10
Stand by Me,stand me timeless film stephen kings story skillfully brought screen under direction rob reiner 1950s brought back life just successfully king so often does his stories novels slicked back hair hot rods film excellent 50s soundtrack there so much more film than just superficial story  things about characters story but also about tremendously talented man who wrote all,8
Stand by Me,without doubt movie probably best coming age flick around has terrific acting incredibly touching plot keeps you going throughout whole film i think reason i love film so much because everyone some way could relate when youre preteen have close group friends face something so intense together theres special bond no matter how much you loose touch each other one day you just think them one incident,8
Stand by Me,stand me about 4 preteen boys whose summer about end they about start junior high theyve obviously grown up together nervous world they about face where they no longer kids but just about become adults when their friend vern tells them about kid their age missing he found out listening his brother where kids body boys think would so cool find body become local town heroes they have one problem though there these big tough guys who want find body first its matter who will reach first but course its bonding boys really gets you into film,10
Stand by Me,these some best characters i have seen film we start gordy gordy intelligent writer who lost his big brother his idol car crash recently cant get any love respect his father its obvious he gets his friends thats what keeps him going chris leader gang gordys best friend he comes very bad family dubbed bad seed everywhere hes kid who you knew school just knew hed turn out bad but theres deeper side him speech river phoenix turned out chris so beautifully dilvered child whos been disappointed so many times adult,8
Stand by Me,teddy another bad kid sort speak he has bad home life where his father crazy nearly killed him few times he has quick temper but you can tell his friends keep him down earth help him through worst times then theres vern funny fat kid who pretty much scarred everything some ways 4th wheel still vern you can tell great friend others appreciate him despite how he can hold them back,5
Stand by Me,acting just phenomenal now directing rob reiner without doubt one best directors all time he took these young boys pushed them their limits he so smart about well he said interview he had get preteen boys who were close personality character film so would come natural preteen actors you could tell film his baby he put so much thought love into film thats what makes film so special nothing could ever compete coming age film like stand me,9
Stand by Me,10oct,10
Stand by Me,i am 14 years old i absolutely love movie but dont let my age fool you im not just going sit here talk about how hott river pheonix,10
Stand by Me,movie well rounded my perspective everyone can relate least one boys one time their life actors matched perfectly who their character portrayscorey feldmans character teddy boy whos sensitive about his dad but tries hide jerry o connells character vern chubby wussy kid but still part club wil wheatons character gordie sweet intelligent friend who tells stories other boys ignored his parents river phoenixs character chris boy neighborhood thats been labeled bad kid feels hell never get out their town peacemaker gordies best friend,9
Stand by Me,movie just sucks you soon you start watching its not overly mushy sad but its not so tough only sixteen year old boy could stand you feel each character no matter how mean nice they my personal favorite chris chambers which i know will probably drive you guys nuts almost every other person does too but river phoenix just so touching campfire scene great milk money seen great one my favorites train scene you can definitely see terror their faces its funny they all act so tough except maybe vern although he tries they still like talking about goofy dancing singing along lollipop you also just want there them feel kind friendship so many people long its such feel good movie but not sense 10 year olds feel good movie makes you feel complete when you watch its not jam packed action sequences doesnt have fluffy pink bunnies hopping around either its just one kind definitely worth my time yours,8
Stand by Me,newest dvd stand me special edition has walking tracks summer stand me where all main actorsexcept river rob reiner interviewed they also talk about working river phoenix theres also stand me music video river phoenix wil wheaton obviously ben e king not mention extra cd some awesome oldies songs like everyday lollipop stand me mr lee,8
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,simply incredible never before have i seen 3 hour movie didnt seem like 3 hours i read lord rings very recently i surprised how similar peter jacksons vision my own,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,now about omissions alterations im not crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail i didnt mind arwens inflation im actually glad tom bombadil scrubbed i felt tom bombadil unnecessary addition book despite these minor changes screenplay stays extremely close book flows very very well prologue nice touch,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,acting flawless ive read many many times other reviews mckellen doesnt play gandalf he gandalf wood mortensen holm astin everyone fantastic my hats off sean bean who delivers excellent performance boromir character whos intentions good but wrestles corrupting power ring bean portrays very well oh andy serkis does perfect gollum voice its exactly i imagined myself,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,special effects were incredible cave troll balrog gollum saurons eye all looked amazing i also very impressed seamless shrinking vertically challenged characters,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,whats wrong movie i have no idea i thought everything perfect my biggest gripe having wait entire year see two towers,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,breathtaking unique captivating enchanting,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,within minutes start first chapter undeniably epic trilogy audience left gasping intensity images screen we had nearly three hours go,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,scope tolkiens masterpiece may have eluded filmmakers decades but director peter jackson makes good his promise he has not only brought us tale frodo his bold companions he has brought us middle earth believe me big sweeping vistas hangontoyourseat camera shots send us zooming through towering cities citadels tolkiens imagination,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,but even more impressive than stunning visuals soundeffectslikeyouveneverheardbefore actors who breathe life into characters ian mckellens portrayal gandalf nothing short aweinspiring elijah woods frodo one most unexpectedly captivating performances ive seen long time despair terror determination fellowship all there spades i left theater achingfrom tensing every muscle during fight flight sequencesthe breathless compelling kind we havent seen since spielberg gave us desperate charge onto dday beaches normandy,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,those unfamiliar tolkiens world may quickly find themselves lost but happily so depth his creation cannot grasped few hours doesnt need struggle good against evil explodes screen leaves little room complaint,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,movie ended stunned audience sitting edges their seats feeling somewhat bereft we were exhausted but no one wanted wait year more,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,jacksons ambitious first chapter truly unlike anything youve seen year george lucas chris columbus take note how you deliver cinematic promise,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,everyone else dont you dare miss,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,no surprise peter jacksons fellowship ring film has received such mixed critics many viewers refer being childish boring uninteresting seems me bound same fate tolkiens books destined target same type misunderstandings keep attacking literary masterpiece many decades after its first publication,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,having read books several years ago i went see impossible film when came out many doubts my mind i really liked but left theater many doubts i had before perfect well maybe not but what achievement after watching few times dvd thinking about some time now i find myself loving film more more let me tell you why,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,lord rings fairytale myth fantasy peter jackson directed film considered very long time impossible make not only technical reasons narrative roots incredibly long detailed storyline deeply connected creation fantastic continent time unknown called middle earth its author tolkien dedicated considerable part his life developing continents background its mythology origins its different kinds people cultures languages therefore its geographic references determinant unfolding story one ring,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,peter jackson went out achieve impossible came out recreation original pure true story every detail first time four hobbits meet black rider road example absolutely faithful feeling book assault riders weathertop another great example captures feeling danger density atmosphere main characteristics tale jackson also took some liberties story made some right choices along way if so called purists may not approve removal tom bombadil altogether should comprehensible travel hobbiton rivendel very long detailed one could easily make movie its own i felt more uneasy how short council elrond book council where whole story rings first explained many passages past ages middle earth unveiled fascinating moment story had shortened obvious reasons still after some consideration i now agree options made peter jackson think movie prologue narrated galadriel wisest choice magic all there when gandalf shuts his eyes moment frodo stands council says i will take ring there morias gate fall boromir powerful film doesnt fit rhythm standard hollywood action movie film breeds takes time unfold its tale branching every direction,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,i could go talking about all different elements bring film close perfection but ill end saying deep down not about action beards big monsters greatest thing about film me brought me back time when i love different world where everything possible reading lord rings night after night i came understand what thing mankind really all about corruption absolute power importance value friendship inevitability growing up strength hope film could capture magic new bearer its message humanism statement its greatness gandalfs words even smallest person may change course world have part play destiny all immortal,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,end wonderful film but doesnt mean you going like i cannot tell you what like see film if you dont know love book but i hope may plant seed your heart discover great world fantasy beauty humanity i believe tolkien would have liked,9
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,my firm belief standard versions lord rings should jettisoned favour extended editions universally sure near 4 hour runtime tad steep but absolute masterpiece like its work every second first act undoubtedly best trilogy cinematic history,10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,but oh i thankful all through movie i kept having big large smile sculpted into my face record im 25 years old ive read lord rings three times first time when i six seven years old ever since then i read least once twice year therefore you can count me fan i follow same cult fan procedure hobbit silmarillion well now onto movie gosh i saw more than one time i keep wanting more just never gets boring i really enjoyed little stuff found throughout movie fans books map bilbos table his house comes mind exactly one hobbit book i own i also incredibly enjoyed intro sequence retelling battle against sauron silmarillion never has ultimate evil being been so well depicted screen truly sauron,10
The Princess Bride,i have been waiting right time review film i did not feel until today i truly ready say all i had say about director rob reiners unforgettable staple 1980s pop culture when i first saw princess bride i only 7 years old hardly cognizant film anything but pastime while i remember movie being enjoyable i did not have anywhere near strong liking appreciation i do now i certainly did not remember film theatergoing experience recently i got chance view big screen least fifty others attendance midnight screening,10
The Princess Bride,personally i am one those people who nature absorbs memorable quotes token entirety princess bride fair game i sat there watching i could always hear somebody if not more than one person least whispering along movie under his her breath meanwhile i noticed there wide disparity age groups there were preteens teens people their twenties thirties some looked well past forty if showing had not been midnight i do not doubt there would have been prepreteens well,10
The Princess Bride,screenplay written william goldman based his book princess bride classic familiar story princess her true love forces come between them evidenced those attendance story all ages manner which fairytale part story executed goldman reiner memorable enough make great film any fan movie will tell you however films whimsical irreverent pervasive tongueincheek antics make unqualified masterpiece,10
The Princess Bride,if you hang around people who love film do not surprised if they react unbelievable situations exclamation inconceivable likewise if you tell them just wait minute dont thrown aback when they suddenly sport spanish accent saying i hate waiting if you suddenly out nowhere hear hellomy name inigo montoyayou killed my fatherprepare die dont worry its not your fault youre not going die,10
The Princess Bride,while princess bride has sort satirical edge more geared towards adults film equally effective pure fairytale reason there little something everyone addition film enacts selfreferential tribute power beauty fairytale stories even current age which many consider them archaic obsolete,9
The Princess Bride,sick grandson fred savage who spending his time mindlessly playing video games nostalgic atari 8bit type gets visit his grandfather portrayed through wonderful performance peter falk grandsons dismay his elder has brought book read him when he expresses disapproval his grandfathers oldfashioned ways grandfathers response when i your age television called books even quote stands out resonant memorable,9
The Princess Bride,grandson starts out expressing skepticism boredom but course reading story progresses gradually gives way captivation praise buttercup robin wright her breakthrough role fairhaired stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged smug cowardly humperdinck chris sarandon prince who rules over land florin she course does not love him she has been without joy since her true love farm boy named wesley cary elwes reportedly murdered seas,10

The Princess Bride,during kidnapping however mysterious man black closes trail three abductors man who takes each three one one battles skill strength smarts course deliciously witty repartee there something unusually extraordinary about these battles however,8
The Princess Bride,exception vezzini abductors not villains we might initially perceive them marvelously choreographed swordplay between man black inigo hilarious absurdity handfight fezzik not all about winning losing they embody sense honor sportsmanship nobility rarely exemplified competition both fictional real,10
The Princess Bride,inigo fezzik man black do not display their skills pretentiously flauntingly instead they take strong sense inner pride subtle mastery their arts result when we see them engage competition there not sense enmity but wonderful air camaraderie,10
The Princess Bride,also included mix sadistic count christopher guest odd physical characteristic penchant pain albino mel smith stuffy throat deadly wrath rous clergyman peter cook who makes elmer fudd seem eloquently spoken most memorable perhaps appearance billy crystal carol kane miracleman max his wife has been reported middle filming scene reiner forced leave set because crystals improvisations were causing him laugh point being sick,10
The Princess Bride,regarding films casting every single choice without exception absolute perfection cary elwes not only easily looks part daring ingenious hero but actor he has incredible gift subtle mixture drama comedy one easily coincides films sensibilities robin wright easily essays role headstrong princess endlessly devoted her love convincing british accent despite her american origins,10
The Princess Bride,scene swordplay elwes patinkin had study fencing months which impressive but onscreen i had no trouble believing they were characters who had studied least several years despite his limited acting ability wrestler andre giant perfect role fezzik something would lost any other actor his place course wallace shawn endlessly amusing watch diminutive perpetually exasperated vezzini,10
The Princess Bride,we also dont have hear christopher guest chris sarandon speak any lines know they portraying villains arrogance callousness sliminess readily apparent their facial bodily expressions,8
The Princess Bride,when all said done we have witnessed wide variety hilarity captivating acts love heroism course one most satisfying acts retribution ever put film one immortalizes films most famous quote chooses just right time placement films sole swear word,10
The Princess Bride,someone who watches film first time quickly catches films capricious mix reverence satire film marvel watch simply knowledge you do not know what will come next will there touching moment reflective one act bravado will our expectations subverted act comical subterfuge answer any them will do film has delectable variety all them,10
The Princess Bride,start finish princess bride transcendent magical experience constantly elicits uproarious laughter simultaneously immerses audience rich magnificent almost nostalgic world folklore after end credits roll seems timeless undying years since its release 1987 has grown into cult film legendary status judging wide variety ages i witnessed screening well endless barrage quoting seems perfectly reasonable assume film will endure many years come,10
The Princess Bride,one those rare films gets better each time you watch something everyone princess bride combines romance action adventure parody create perfect movie,9
The Princess Bride,cary elwes robin wright beautiful watch story their love wonderful backdrop adventure intrigue played out story mandy patinkin wonderful inigo gets deliver some best lines film chris sarandon perfect his role bad guy prince,10

Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,overall movie total waste time,1
Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,simply put without wasting anybodys time unlike my time wasted watching garbage birds prey etc chance completely wasted shouldve been harley quinn add any lame title here theres no notable presence birds prey here film how harley quinn stood against gay version black mask,3
Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,plot story directing true heart chick flick clearly influenced feminist movement script emphasizing blindly discriminating against men representing all male characters either gay bisexual portrait evil traitorous manner female other hand represented sadly based race not relation comics character nor fans desire which clearly method trying tastelessly involve everyone no race feels left out ie choosing asian cassandra cain over barbra gordon,1
Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,disaster starts casting process ill never stop believing margot robbie very bad depiction harley quinn looks which feels way off margot has long face while harley has round face fact she does not feel sound same least say how different arleen sorkin says mr j puddin nerdy yet playful way how margot fails represent not mention ridiculous child size mallet they gave her movie i believe main reason why many fans drool over margot first place mainly because they didnt see anyone else play role big screen yet not because margot good actress can represent harley well scenes decorations feels like designed crazed extravagant fashion designer fighting scenes along directing obviously all over place disastrous manner,2

Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,could have been such good movie movie took few steps too many into woke space while some elements fit well theme becomes tiring if same message constantly being repeated over over over simply spoils movie,8
Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,dud warner bros best thing about suicide squad robbies performance but vehicle disservice potential there robbie does her best but direction script editing not requisite level interesting character poorly treated very lacklustre script disappointing,1
Pulp Fiction,one early scenes pulp fiction features two hitmen discussing what big mac called other countries their dialogue witty entertaining its also disarming because makes these two thugs seem all too normal if you didnt know better you might assume these were regular guys having chitchat their way work other than comic payoff end scene which they use parts conversation taunt their victims their talk has no relevance anything film anything else matter yet without such scenes pulp fiction wouldnt pulp fiction i get sense tarantino put into film whatever struck his fancy somehow final product not only coherent but wonderfully textured,10
Pulp Fiction,its no wonder fans spend so much time debating what suitcase reading far more into story than tarantino probably intended film so intricately structured so many astonishing details many which you wont pick up first viewing seems cry out some deeper explanation but there no deeper explanation pulp fiction title indicates purely exercise technique style albeit brilliant layered one containing numerous references other films like great work abstract art art about art has all characteristics we associate great movies fine writing firstrate acting unforgettable characters one most wellconstructed narratives ive ever seen film but what end selfcontained story does not seem have bearing anything but itself,10
Pulp Fiction,movie becomes bit easier understand once you realize its essentially black comedy dressed up crime drama each three main story threads begins situation could easily form subplot any standard gangster movie but something always goes wrong some small unexpected accident causes whole situation come tumbling down leading increasingly desperate characters absurd measures tarantinos originality stems his ability focus small details follow them where they lead even if they move story away conventional plot developments,10
Pulp Fiction,perhaps no screenplay has ever found better use digressions indeed whole film seems consist digressions no character ever says anything simple straightforward manner jules could have simply told yolanda cool no ones going get hurt which just type line youd find generic runofthemill action flick instead he goes off tangent about what fonzie like tarantino savors every word his characters finding potential wisecrack every statement infusing dialogue clever pop culture references but lines arent just witty they full intelligent observations about human behavior think mias statement vincent thats when you know youve found somebody special when you can just shut f up minute comfortably enjoy silence,10
Pulp Fiction,what movies purpose exactly im not sure but does deal lot theme power marsellus sort character who looms over entire film while being invisible most time whole point big date sequence which happens my favorite section film power marsellus has over his men without even being present power what gets vincent act ways you would not ordinarily expect dumb stoned gangster faced attractive woman whose husband has gone away power theme also helps explain one more controversial aspects film its liberal use nword film word isnt just used epithet describe blacks jules instance one point applies term vincent has more do power than race powerful characters utter word express their dominance over weaker characters most these gangsters not racist practice indeed they intermingled racially have achieved level equality surpasses habits many lawabiding citizens our society they resort racial epithets because its patter establishes their separateness noncriminal world,10
Pulp Fiction,theres nice moral progression stories we presume vincent hesitates sleep mia out fear rather than loyalty later butchs act heroism could motivated honor but were never sure film ends however jules making clear moral choice thus movie seems exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than selfpreservation,10
Pulp Fiction,still its hard find much larger meaning tying together these eccentric set stories none stories really about anything they certainly not about hitmen pontificating about burgers nor film really satire farce although contains elements both times feels like tale didnt need told but whatever reason movie tells does better job than most films its kind any other kind,10
Pulp Fiction,i can only speak myself but i had never seen anything stylish cleverly constructed well written electrifying milestone when i first saw 1994 what really pulled me right start what weve now come know tarantino trademark dialogue when gangsters jules vincent talk each other all other characters matter there natural flow sense realism yet something slightly over top very theatrical about their lines – its mixture immediately grabs your attention even if its just two dudes talking about what kind hamburger they prefer contemplating value footmassage then theres music songs tarantino chose his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly most those pieces music now immediately associated pulp fiction narrative different story lines come together elegantly used flashbacks use chapters – there so much playful creativity play here its just pure joy watch,9
Pulp Fiction,if youre bit film geek you realize how much knowledge about film love work other greats – inspiration them went into leone depalma scorsese course dozens hyperstylized asian gangster flicks but those accusing tarantino copying even stealing other filmmakers i can only say there has never been artist who adored his kind art not inspired influenced his favorite artists if you watch tarantinos masterpiece today its impossible not recognize just what breath fresh air still actually somehow movies especially gangster films never looked quite same after pulp fiction probably most influential film last 20 years its got simply everything amazing performances especially sam jackson features some most sizzling iconic dialogue ever written has arguably one best nonoriginal soundtracks ever its such crazy cool inspirational ride you feel dizzy after watching first time its – well its pulp fiction 10 stars out 10,10

Pulp Fiction,put context i am 34 years old i have say best film i have seen without doubt i dont expect will beaten far i am concerned obviously times move i acknowledge due its violence one particularly uncomfortable scene film not everyone but i still remember watching first time blew me away anyone who watches now has remember actually changed history cinema context followed decade more action films always ended chase sequence where hero saved day you could have written those films yourself pulp had you gripped credited audience intelligence there not line wasted dialogue movie incorporates number complexities not immediately obvious also resurrected career grease icon john travolta highlighted acting talent samuel l jackson there many films now edited out sequence have multiple plots etc but one they all want all want beat but never will,5
Pulp Fiction,if you think pulp fiction brilliant youre wrong its more than its milestone history film making its already classic but why because many f words maybe because brain skull pieces rear window car no thats surely not point unfortunately some other users fortunately minority dont get tarantino has made movie thats someway different many other action gangster crime movies whats so different he knows subject movie cool he knows its product mass culture he even likes himself but he smiles tells three great stories lot irony irony first point second point he gave souls extremely schematic characters they surely arent another action heroes who you forget fast you can twinkle they human beings like we talking about burger king mcdonalds about tv series foot massage they just earn their money killing others selling drugs what else so great about pulp fiction its acting directing cinematography soundtrack sense humour whole rest my opinion its all worth nothing less than 10 out 10 masterpiece,6
Pulp Fiction,viewers taken ride through three different stories entertwine together around world marcellus wallace quentin tarantino proves he master witty dialogue fast plot doesnt allow viewer moment boredom rest story two hitman job fixed boxing match date between hitman wife mob boss there definitely lot care into writing script everything no matter order fits story many mysteries have been left such what inside briefcase why marcellus wallace has bandaid back his neck which may connected movie redefined action genre reinvigorated careers both john travolta bruce willis movie required viewing any fan film,10
Pulp Fiction,pulp fiction may single best film ever made quite appropriately one most creative directors all time quentin tarantino movie amazing beginning definition pulp end credits boasts one best casts ever assembled likes bruce willis samuel l jackson john travolta uma thurman harvey keitel tim roth christopher walken dialog surprisingly humorous type film i think thats what has made so successful wrongfully denied many oscars nominated pulp fiction far best film 90s no tarantino film has surpassed quality movie although kill bill came close far im concerned top film alltime definitely deserves watch if you havent seen,10
Pulp Fiction,my oh my pulp fiction one those rollercoasters movie both joy trial sit through amazingly original unforgettable quentin tarantinos trash masterpiece never gets old seem outdated put face american independent film making 1994 miramax had been around since 1970s no one had heard before film studios went into panic when film came out because they knew would amazing hit course independent film making became rage hit its peak 1996 when four five nominated best picture films were independent studios screenplay direction tarantino quite amazing but cast makes film work john travolta oscar nominated reinvented his career film bruce willis cemented his celebrity samuel l jackson uma thurman both oscar nominees became marketable superstars others who make appearances include ving rhames christopher walken eric stoltz rosanna arquette steve buscemi frank whaley harvey keitel course quentin tarantino himself they all leave lasting impressions well samuel l jackson stood out most me his lack substantial screen time may have cost him oscar just amazing accomplishment all involved deserve recognition easily 5 stars out 5,5

Jojo Rabbit,one wouldnt off base asking why successful filmmaker would tackle such risky project comingofage comedydramafantasy about 10 year old nazi fanatic who has his imaginary friend not 6 foot rabbit but fuhrer himself adolph hitler after all writerdirector waititi coming off couple brilliant indies 2014s what we do shadows 2016s hunt wilderpeople major score marvel money thor ragnarok 2017 arguably most entertaining superhero movie past few years he certainly could have continued cash safer choices however mr waititi sees world differently than most us he finds humor drudgery humanity malevolence hes also bit goofy,9
Jojo Rabbit,playing over opening credits german version i want hold your hand we see old clips german citizens cheering adolph hitler similar manner how fans used scream beatles world war ii nearing end we meet 10 year old jojo betzler newcomer roman griffin davis jojo fervent his fanaticism towards nazi way buys into belief jews monsters horns their head hes such believer his imaginary friend actually hitler well least bumbling boisterous version played filmmaker himself enacted extreme comedy effect recalling bit chaplin great dictator mel brooks managed play hitler laughable extreme springtime hitler producers but only thing missing her waititis costume old timey dunce cap,10

Jojo Rabbit,its rare film borders slapstick times have so many touching emotional moments actors really strong here especially ms johansson ms mckenzie who gutsy elsa proves again she quickly becoming powerhouse young actor roman griffin davis carries significant weight story despite being first time actor i cant emphasize enough how young archie yates will steal your heart while hes stealing his scenes michael giacchinos score mihai malaimaire jrs terrific cinematography work well waititis vision satirical vision would never work outside his unique filmmaking talent story basically proof adage kill em kindness when what we really killing hatred its core story humanity human nature how we grab hold wrong thing until truth becomes evident now please pass unicorn,10
Jojo Rabbit,another taika his best taking him back his bittersweet indie roots his storytelling humanity shows through every moment story 10 year old nazi youth full swing his countrys ideology indoctrination he starts his journey his invisible best friend adolf hitler taika waititi himself going off hitler youth camp his mother wild endearing woman playful attitude during horrible time war movie starts off hilariously but takes little bit time allow yourself feel okay laughing side german war little boy who wants nothing more than do right his fuhrer after terrible hilariously acted accident discovery his mother hiding young jewish girl their attic his ideals turned upside down thoughts war he has grown up its simple message delivered way tells you what you already know facism bad its story taika tells us needs told over over again because people easily turn blind eye horrors humankind but heart love can prevail roman griffin davis thomasin mckenzie great pair carry film warmth wonderful comedic scenes but its scarlett johansson who leaves us memory what means right side humanity take life comes teach your children what you can when you can even surrounded wellknown substantial actors these two children stand out bring movies warm embrace taika never afraid lead joke but he always takes time bring his message humanity home hanging sad moments life too not jumping over lifes tragedies get next oneliner he balances good bad perfectly leaving you walking away warm feeling your belly,9
Jojo Rabbit,just watch see yourself my opinion hilarious heartfelt acting superb story thought provoking funny times heartbreaking times im huge fan what we do shadows i am huge fan jojo rabbit go support film theatre so more films like can made i cant wait see what taika waititi does next🙏🏻 ps im jew,9
Jojo Rabbit,probably one most controversial films come out tiff i went into jojo rabbit cautionious optimism since i am fan taika waititi while still being aware divineness has spawned some critics i pleasantly surprised how emotional thought provoking he made film while still being very funny without going too far,8
Jojo Rabbit,jojo 10year old boy who dreams fighting his country making his hero proud hero just so happens adolf hitler during final year ww2 jojos blind fanaticism so extreme he imagines adolf his best friend give him advice which no surprise not helpful after accident hitler youth camp jojo has stay his mother only discover she hiding elsa teenage girl who very thing his nazis beliefs have told him fear hate jew jojo tries learn about elsas kind he begins sees elsa thoughtful yet scared person she really not monster his beliefs have told her,9
Jojo Rabbit,smartest thing i can say waitia knows when make joke about nazis beliefs ideals but then let bleakness ww2 set embrace deeper themes emotions within first act jojo sees his world through rosetinted glasses he gleefully gives nazi salute his fellow neighbours bright sunny day all nazi characters heightened exaggerated comic relief sam rockwells captain klenzendorf being tired annoyed german soldier rebel wilson ignorant fraulein rahm stephen merchant gestapo agent deertz waititi takes pleasure making nazis but joke showing them being overcommitted saluting each other just simple introduction their obliviousness believing any stupid fake news they told came hilter himself once jojo settles elsa sharing his house his world begins show its true ugliness germany becomes more desperate hold their ground against allied forces point waititi slows down comedy allows moments shock drama settle remind audience what horrible cost ignorance blind faith cinematographer mihai malaimare jr switches color scheme bright saturated cold grey seasons pass reflect change jojos state mind parallels modern day become very clear without getting too blunt,7
Jojo Rabbit,cast plays each their roles perfectly roman griffin davis carries story naïve but yet innocence jojo davis perfectly cast perfect comedic timing while still being able sell emotional beats needed he has great comedic emotional chemistry thomasin mckenzie elsa mckenzie displays hardship her character has gone throughout her life yet still making her fun sharpwitted when she points out shallowness jojos ideals also who worth mentioning scarlett johansson jojos mother rosie probably best performance johansson i have seen so far she brings huge feeling joy optimism needed help jojos growth character out all adults blind horrors axis power inflicting upon world rosie only one able see through confront big question waititi himself playing young boys interpretation adolf hitler he handles very well his comedic performance there show absurdity jojos brainwashing naziss teaching helps he never tries humanize portrayal his character there were even few moments where he becomes bit more antagonistic towards jojo he begins doubting faith his idol,10
Jojo Rabbit,jojo rabbit may controversial pick if does get nominated awards consideration after i saw last day tiff surprisingly won peoples choice award but i feel like movie needed todays political issues taika waititi uses story boys misguided fantasy faith show how easy society manipulated into hating minorities religions andor groups people especially when fake news social media present but end day he shows compassion love still worth embracing cruel world so long we able confront cruelty ourselves first,6
Jojo Rabbit,german i loved everything about movie absurdity these times captured amazingly now almost century afterwards we can take some humor well done i hope movie goes win some awards,10
Jojo Rabbit,jojo rabbit demonstrates there hope both humanity hollywood latter i mean its hard imagine how film original got made era reboots remakes sequels prequels mostly bad,10
Gladiator,ridley scotts gladiator not perfect film i would think hardiest fans which im firmly one know deep down yet just like commodus film keen point out he himself has other virtues worthy so does gladiator film enough fact make everlasting favourite genre fans worthy academy award acknowledgements received,10
Gladiator,narrative terms plot story arc simplicity supreme something scott russell crowe have never shied away there has my knowledge well never been denial debt gladiator owes anthony manns 1964 epic fall roman empire some folk seem very irritated which strange because makers gladiator were not standing up bold brass proclaim they were unique their movie what they did do reinvigorate stagnant genre film new generational audience bloody worked influence interest all things roman historically swashbuckling film followed post gladiators success there all see,10
Gladiator,what we do life echoes eternity,10
Gladiator,so no originality story then while some cgi hardly grade stuff theres little over mugging acting support ranks some cast struggle grasp period setting required yet way gladiator can make emotionally committed feel overrides film making irks crowes maximus man men want man women want he runs through gamut lifes pains emotionally fortified trials tribulations we him every step way urging him towards his day revenge splattered destiny crowe superb every pained frame winning academy award best actor he should have won insider previous year,10
Gladiator,backing crowe up joaquin phoenix giving commodus preening villainy connie nielsen graceful lucilla pitch nielsens turn here against diane krugers troy see class difference historical period playing oliver reed leaving mortal coil but leaving behind spicy two fold performance proximo gladiator task master olly superb both body cgi soul richard harris tugging heart strings derek jacobi classy david hemmings also while djimon hounso gives juba maximus right hand man confidante level character gravitas thats inspiring,10
Gladiator,i didnt know man could build such things,10
Gladiator,dialogue literate poetic resplendent iconic speeches action never far away but never expense wrought human characterisations flaming arrows blood letting germania conflict kicks things off pulse raising clarity scott his team never sag standard gladiator arena fights edge seat inducing recreation battle carthage stunning piece action sequence construction then finale culmination two mens destinies no soft soaping scott crowe lands heart resounding thunderclap great swords sandals movie tipped its helmet past masters whilst simultaneously bringing genre alive again bravo maximus decimus meridius 1010,10
Gladiator,gladiator historical epic director ridley scott after being betrayed new caesar roman general maximus sold into slavery gladiator where he rises fame peoples champion finds opportunity exact his revenge russell crowe joaquin phoenix connie nielsen lead cast deliver strong performances additionally gladiator fights especially dynamic exciting featuring several different styles combat costumes sets also remarkably welldone create vivid depiction ancient rome hans zimmers score does excellent job capturing tone film thrilling actionpacked gladiator delivers compelling tale you not entertained,9
Gladiator,once again director ridley scott proves professional one can recreation ancient rome splendid all its magnificent buildings atmosphere he able show all brightness greatness roman empire its political problems military discipline love treason hate jealousy still have place our world today but story has glow its own which all beautiful scenery believe me its awesome great cinematography just balancing factors plot rich one dynamic present he once again after blade runner 1492 others helps us visit depths human soul which remains same over all our historical social experience even fights displayed such way all blood quite discrete but still making us feel like screaming jumping out our seats i would also like point out performances cast surprisingly good we have some actors actresses who not hollywood icons but greatly able move audience among screams tears all all we have guys like russel crowe who coming out part new extremely promising harvest people who making each time more fans around world well you should see yourself,10
Gladiator,most films require viewer identifies character truly engrossed film if you cant feel something character than audience lost,10
Gladiator,luckily ridley scotts case russel crowe so captivating convincing general loved his troops slave loved people movie really works possibly one greatest actors today crowe carries epic film his very capable shoulders,10
Gladiator,not say he only reason works supporting cast most notably connie neilsen buoy film new perspectives,8
Gladiator,jacquin phoenix definitely captures egotisitcal persona he should display stealing every scene hes phoenix will surely put map gladiator,9
Gladiator,but real shining star film incredible action sequences which jolt viewer right opening sequences maximus true worth roman empire displayed scotts camera work within these completed sequences takes modern twist really works gruesome scenes,10
Gladiator,crowe will now get respect he deserves collosal performance gladiator makes most its 2 half hours marking triumphant comeback long forgotten epics classic days film all hail maximus,10
Gladiator,great story great writing great acting great directing great score movie has all i especially enjoyed mood film even though has lot action there subtle elegance throughout picture gives great style movie flows effortlessly scene scene while same time creating wonderful intensity nailbiting excitement,9
Gladiator,acting movie more than lives up expectations russell crowe brilliant his role maximus general who became slave who became gladiator who defied emperor crowes intense style perfect relentless determination confidence maximus joaquin phoenix equally wonderful his role commodus corrupt emperor he plays great villain because he able give commodus depth showing certain vulnerable fragile sides while same time instantly transforming let ruthless nature his volatile character shine also helps joaquin has classic caesar look works perfectly his role,7
Gladiator,connie nielsen also very good lucilla however perhaps two finest performances movie were given couple acting veterans supporting roles richard harris oliver reed were exceptional what will remembered crowning achievements end their careers harris perfect marcus aurelius aging caesar who reflects upon his life contemplates how world will remember him reed especially gave my personal favorite performance movie proximo trainer gladiators way he spoke about life gladiator splendor rome thrill coliseum really added excitement anticipation during viewing movie,10
Gladiator,gladiator filled many memorable moments one would need see more than once fully appreciate excitement felt me when rome first shown all its wonder marvel my favorite scene but whole movie rush hans zimmer provides absolute perfect score capture different moods movie ridley scott sets perfect tone his artistic creative directing i would recommend anyone who can stomach intensity enjoy epic story ages next braveheart movie greatest alltime,7
Gladiator,gladiator definitely classic film combines simple but moving story beautiful scenery filming direction score  truly complete movie,10

Aquaman,i have no idea why somebody would give movie good score let alone 10 after 20 minutes i have decided its best switch my brain off enjoy show but damn movie way too dumb character development rushed given form cringy weak dialogues jokes feel like they just out place but specific moments created just them happen which makes even more ridiculous there some really stunning shots but its more exception rather than rule but main issue which makes movie unwatchable without least 4 cans beer fact its linear hell there 0 unpredictable plot twists beginning movie even trailers you sure know how its going end also mood unbelievably inconsistent some points characters dead serious while 2 minutes they may cracking jokes its not bad justice league but black manta just looks pathetic his constanty frowny angry face wb u evil corporate idiots stop ruining your movies trying like marvel making movies based formula which clearly doesnt work just looks like parody not well done one,3
Aquaman,aquaman quite classy smart,2
Aquaman,here he thuggish beefcake talks trash spends his time topless beach,1
Aquaman,no wonder humanity decline industrial pollutants,2
Aquaman,he would fit lot more slim than impostor film,1
Aquaman,way whats up sound being transmitted underwater like rian johnson dropping bombs space like last jedi again,3
Aquaman,has anyone read aquaman comics does anyone know aquamans story does anyone care aquaman,2
Aquaman,film story weird tattooed trash amphibian thug who speaks like hoodlum who some reason gets trained beach his top off like trashy beefcake antihero 21st century something,4
Aquaman,what rubbish,2
Aquaman,now mystery has been resolved i have no interest film,1
Aquaman,boring cliched main actor probably another those mma meat heads brain damage if there were any brains begin story defies physics,8
Aquaman,poor true aquaman,1
Aquaman,i dont know where hype film comes because cant content dialogue characters movie often ridiculous least entertaining way possible silly can entertaining but can also just feel stupid female characters only seem exist aquamans conscience because he cant think himself hes boring they have no flaws vices other words no depth villain cheap charicature warmonger few poorly expressed environmental ideas thrown into his perspective good points film fall mostly visuals stunning film terms undersea beauty portrayed literal riot colour across screen i would also say action pretty positive combat intense epic overral though i wouldnt reccomend,9
Inglourious Basterds,review gives everything away so see movie first,10
Inglourious Basterds,neither allegory nor satire two finest categories both fiction cinema yet approaches perfection anyway nature i have no name but nature reveals truth undermines falsehoods,10
Inglourious Basterds,nothing more cloaked falsehood than victors depiction past wars especially true children victorsespecially children us wwii veterans like myself,10
Inglourious Basterds,we get our view war movies like audi murphy hell back saving private ryan nothing but praise our heroes cheers killing enemy,5
Inglourious Basterds,but qt exposes hypocrisy engineering film where we disgusted first excesses enemy then excesses our heroes first instance hypocrisy slammed home second instance where we first disgusted sight american after american being shot dead german sniper hero secondly brought revel butchery several hundred enemy hands our heroes tit tat,8
Inglourious Basterds,fits pattern praise our heroes cheers killing enemy but because presented both ways hypocrisy becomes self evident why so many people hate movieeven if they fail realize high art true art 10 10,1
Inglourious Basterds,thats what i thought when i heard about cast inglorious basterds im both germany into movies,9
Inglourious Basterds,guy older than 50 so far he almost only played mediocre tv series even there he didnt play main parts obviously nobody ever noticed what hes capable now thanks qt he got one shot change lets put way bingo he living proof what great caster tarrantino,7
Inglourious Basterds,way i think its great privilege watch movie german being able understand everything german dialog written almost good english,7
Inglourious Basterds,now i could repeat what many others have written here before ill put short finally qt back,9
Inglourious Basterds,i had privilege attending uk premier inglorious basterds evening having seen trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due string self indulgent films cmon lets honest self indulgence his tarantinos middle name,8
Inglourious Basterds,i surprised find though he had pulled cat out bag one film rich interesting dialogue perfect timed comedy dash brutal assassination,10
Inglourious Basterds,crowning glory film though lies christoph waltz whom no fault error can found he manages create real tension audience whilst remaining quite theatrical couldnt think better word he definitely deserved his prize cannes heading oscar no doubt hoping see him something again soon,1
Inglourious Basterds,after watching inglorious basterds i really surprised when i saw ratings imdb didnt expected high ratings top 250 place if we can only isolate rate christoph waltzs acting performance i would agree movie deserves 10 but he not alone his performance cant cover horrible plot boring conversations unfunny characters alternative qt ww2 fantasy eli roth jew bear,1
Inglourious Basterds,opening scene denis menochet farmer christoph waltz ss officer best part movie only part have same quality connects tension scene rest movie basement scene basement scene crossroad me michael fassbender great role british spy his character adds some new layer logic realism movie moments you can actually see some plot finally breaking through rubbish you watched after farm scene after basement chapter movie going nowhere,10
Inglourious Basterds,empty space lot empty space movie last 153 minutes long boring scenes boring characters conversations childish fantasy mixed up spaghetti western movies some atmosphere dont belong ww2 period thats why we have basterds fill everything else patch rest movie they failed basterds weakestundeveloped most boring part movie movie named them yes brad movie poster but they horrible worst role mr pitt i hope last one eli roth,1
Inglourious Basterds,cinemashosanna story david bowie music just another qt patch v11 fill huge empty space between farm basement extremely boring scenes mélanie laurent taking off cinema letters red dresses secret love marcel will blast your brain yes headache must,1
Inglourious Basterds,beside 2 good scenes i really enjoyed listening smooth gradient german french english language but again connected waltz fassbender their personal knowledge tarantino used his fantasy,1
Inglourious Basterds,inglorious basterds hybrid movie where gangsters replaced nazis adding them wild west background layer brad pitt movie poster just sell tickets doesnt work case,1
Inglourious Basterds,510 only christoph waltz michael fassbender,1
Inglourious Basterds,fun engrossing beautifully crafted piece nonsense likes which we hadnt seen long long time silliness story marvelously camouflaged great dialogue some superb performances christoph waltz must thinking already about his acceptance speech what performance civilized monster polyglot refined deadly he gets us going first sensational scene brad pitt also wonderful he putting mussolinni chin while impersonating hilariously italian i thought so his characters name sounds like aldo ray im sure thats no accident film full movie references another character named fenek homage his 1970s sexpot edwige fenech what already one tarantinos trademarks his sure step along most immediately recognizable bits pop culture hes clearly not cultured man but pop expert king world where people get their news tv dont read other than magazines comics etc thats how happens right place right time better worse tarantino times,1
Inglourious Basterds,i will just start some quotes other reviewers describes best,1
Inglourious Basterds,easily one most overrated films year probably worst film tarantino has ever done only good thing movie performance mr waltz,6
Frozen II,im 34 years old i loved first one saw three times theaters immediately bought soundtrack afterward,1
Frozen II,first one had me my toes whole time story progressed smoothly songs had purpose theme let go relatable,1
Frozen II,sequel had none they stuff contrived story down your throat having explain everything each step because nothing made sense songs totally forgettable filler there no meaningful conflict climax nonexistent,3
Frozen II,real shame,6
Frozen II,movie filled songs all over place because has almost no story same crap beauty beast 2,2
Frozen II,your kids will love theres no doubt about there serious talent behind song writers performers animation team plotline itself very well done issue its execution film almost two hours long everything rushed film can only described outline paper made into film without flesh between frozen 2 hardly gave audience time process one scene before we were thrown into another character motivations emotions were traded comedy relief form olaf sentient equivalent exposition,2
Frozen II,film fails narrate how character got certain point why transpired motivations behind each party however overly narrates message film quite literally through olaf exposition mentioned above,6
Frozen II,after being such strong character first installment anna fell short her emotions were conflicting not good way kristoffs only purpose film find way ask anna very serious question olaf had no other purpose journey while elsas journey saving grace film portrayed itself if had cut out 30 minutes important back story character decision making film lacked emotion first sense thrill dread traded series beautiful visuals fluid animation,3
Frozen II,score good but not memorable animation absolutely stunning childs perspective film would given 1010 but film review standpoint frozen 2 failed deliver,2
Frozen II,frozen ii felt unsatisfying there lots build up very short climax felt way too easy simple i kept expecting another adventure which never came film feels short unfinished said animation absolutely gorgeous i did find film quite funny if you go into low expectations i think youll enjoy yourself,3
Frozen II,animations where great story very poor better have great story poor animations than other way around story needlessly complicated children not able catch audience,9
Frozen II,one incoherent nonsense mess felt like story being made up went along end credits about 68 different writers perhaps explained reason,1
Frozen II,nothing like first movie based hans christian andersons snow queen no charm characters such olaf were simply irritating i couldnt care if any them would have lived died except kristoff when movie trying produce drama characters were crying i felt nothing,7
Frozen II,kristoffs song lost woods sequence were pretty good rest movie consisted completely irritating songs lacked rhyming where necessary character will start singing i thinking oh no not another song how long going,6
Frozen II,gets 2 me literally one point above minimum kristoffs song,1
Frozen II,totally doesnt deserve success its had patronising nonsense 6 years making just complete disgrace,3
Frozen II,before i say anything let me tell you some girls were crying around my seats so i think movie hits its demograhy,1
Frozen II,i liked visuals movie looks amazing better than first one theres lot more going happening movie its just 1hour 50 mins long so lot arcs very rushed convenient there scenea where one character tells other what they have do get something no explanation reasons theres lot i mean lots exposition characters tell stories tell something they just know feel flashbacks hallucinations kindof stuff,1
Frozen II,but movie aimed kids its okay if story wasnt technically sound but adults movie might too silly times,1
Frozen II,about songs time expectations were high i didnt like single song movie there were times when i felt they just ripped off their own song previous movie let go like last time no song connected emotiolly character but theyre well performed,2
Frozen II,kudos animation team voice actors artdesigners not so much writers screen play writers,1
Frozen II,wooden dialogue otherwise well delivered excessive number outright bad songs only one exception were none less well sung,2
Frozen II,character arcs motivations were rudimentary though least they were not outofcharacter yet overall narrative barely held together coherent story its entirely literal call adventure then through one contrived conflict convenient solution after another ending series underwhelming climaxes,10
Frozen II,poor writing problem screenwriting songwriting there were decent ideas throughout film consistently failed their implementation made film trying but failing punch well above its weight more like directtovideo aladdin sequel higher production values then unexpected breakout success frozen,2
Terminator: Dark Fate,we when we watch when we pay ticket we encourage these people keep trowing garbarge us we need stop,3
Terminator: Dark Fate,ill honest dark fate more mediocre than unwatchable probably best terminator since t2 yeah i know bar so low its like limbo dancing point feels similar force awakens itself slick decent movie but ive already watched much better original so thanks but no thanks,5
Terminator: Dark Fate,positives mackenzie davis whom ive had hopeless crush since seeing her cute nasa geek martian then again blade runner 2049 plays relatable compelling character intriguing mix power vulnerability there also couple neat setpieces especially first half before everything becomes overthetop tiresome,6
Terminator: Dark Fate,linda hamilton arnold show up fanservice its kind nice see them both back significant roles but typical fanservice its like gorging too much chocolate tastes good first but then come nausea vague feeling shame,3
Terminator: Dark Fate,my main point terminator series now hopeless last movies especially genisys have poisoned well continuity mess keeps being rebooted so everything pointless no development can feel meaningful show hands who would particularly surprised if next terminator movie once again about john connor leading resistance another alternate continuity no one thought so,1
Terminator: Dark Fate,also new villain being so talkative possibly single stupidest idea whole project you know why arnold t1 robert patrick t2 were so terrifying because they shut up they said very little few times they spoke always felt like something they did out pure necessity probing informations setting up trap but fundamentally alien their nature,2
Terminator: Dark Fate,rev9 tries talk its antagonists out fighting him can anyone picture t1000 reasoning its targets great robert patrick studied imitated body language birds prey look creepier inhuman new bad guy wants chat give me break,2
Terminator: Dark Fate,10may,1
Terminator: Dark Fate,really isnt sequel t2 plot movie actually negates first two movies only retell basically same story there some great action sequences story basically same previous terminator films someone future sent back past protect only hope future,2
Terminator: Dark Fate,we know t2 skynet stopped so judgment day never happens but none matters because new company called legion ends up doing same thing future anyway basically movie tells us ai judgment day inevitable even if they stop legion movie another company can just take its place any future sequel,5
Terminator: Dark Fate,its like they wrote down all political commentaries they wanted movie then just filled rest just copied pasted without any regard plot logic entertaining value whatsoever all those 1010 reviews insulting people not liking incredibly bad movie hilarious apparently you not allowed dislike female lead movies no matter how atrocious so they call you troll incel racist misogynist some them even say its better than 1 2 which goes show how credible these reviews anyways movie has no entertaining value no substance definitely worst terminator movie yet if you havent seen watch sarah connor chronicles instead if youre looking good action movie solid strong female characters there plenty choose,2
Terminator: Dark Fate,alien franchise underworld franchise resident evil franchise hunger games franchise battle angel alita ghost shelltomb raider atomic blonde salt mad max fury road hanna haywire sucker punch wonder woman kill bill 1 2 red sparrow,1
Terminator: Dark Fate,trust me there reason movie total flop lost so much money its not sexism any other silly excuse these virtue signaling fake reviewers will throw you,4
Terminator: Dark Fate,expanse incredibly awesome scifi tv show filled amazing strong female characters all around two them drummer avasarala being my favorite characters show far so if you looking quality entertainment lots lots cool strong female characters must you,1
Terminator: Dark Fate,movie starts off killing john connor there thats all you need know everything sarah connor kyle reese went through terminator 1 nothing everything john sarah uncle bob went through terminator 2 nothing,5
Terminator: Dark Fate,retcon would make highlander 2 blush envy turns out skynet had actually sent back multiple terminators take out john move not only goes against entire internal logic terminator 2 but also carries added weight having irrevocably defiled emotional weight uncle bobs heartrending death scene case anyone forgot sole reason he died because his last cpu could lead skynets creation he willingly accepted his fate prevent happening,5
Terminator: Dark Fate,but whatever they stopped skynet so now new rogue ai has taken its place because what else they gonna do sent back terminator kill some random girl whos gonna become new leader resistance against skynet 20 tell me if things start sounding familiar you because im having serious deja vu here,1
Terminator: Dark Fate,oh yeah terminator killed john same one played arnold just like terminator 3 only time hes moved started family settled down were somehow supposed care about guy essentially murdered 2 great movies worth development,5
Terminator: Dark Fate,theres also blonde manrobot thing defies categorization both genderwise humanwise main antagonist some mexican guy who suffers such lack presence menace robert patrick could obliterate him glare,2
Terminator: Dark Fate,movie basically ends sarah adopting whatshername train her become future leader human resistance did i ever tell you definition insanity actually i just did,1
Terminator: Dark Fate,did i just spoil movie you yes i did should you care if you have any love terminator 1 2 everything they stand then nono you shouldntbecause nobody involved making thing cared one bitand shows all its abhorrent wretchedness,2
Terminator: Dark Fate,28 years3 horrible sequels each one worse than lastand now here we fabled official continuation terminator 2and we havent budged single goddamn inch since 1991 yup,2
Terminator: Dark Fate,future not set because its destined repeat itself there no fate but what we make ourselvesuntil next hack writer comes along decides ex machina everything back square 1,1
Terminator: Dark Fate,what actual did creators movie think we forgot everything occurred before did they think we got neuralized mib style you know some us old enough remember terminator timeline terminator chain events,1
Terminator: Dark Fate,they completely crapped terminator franchise its like writers didnt even know there existed terminator movie before one,1
Twilight,i think movie suffered lack good script bad acting,6
Twilight,my interpretation weekend i had endure working my movie theater all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who i think wouldve just about died anticipation seeing twilight im not kidding i personally witnessed twelve year old say she wanted have robert pattinsons baby ok so how i saw movie my sister ironically my older sister has been just raving about twilight series her friends told me i have read these books after weeks bugging me i finally broke down read them actually its kind fun series reminded me same love i had tv series buffy vampire slayer when i young teen but course she has take me midnight premiere 100000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down crawling all over each other just see movie,5
Twilight,bella swan has always been little bit different never caring about fitting trendy girls her phoenix high school when her mother remarries sends bella live her father rainy little town forks washington she doesnt expect much anything change then she meets mysterious beautiful edward cullen intelligent witty he sees straight into her soul soon bella edward swept up passionate decidedly unorthodox romance edward can run faster than mountain lion he can stop moving car his bare hands he hasnt aged since 1918 like all vampires hes immortal but he doesnt have fangs he doesnt drink human blood,1
Twilight,so my opinion about twilight movie honestly its average its my junior high romance vampire i hate beyond hate say im hypocrite saying but because i read book before i saw movie i had completely different interpretation what characters look like how they say certain lines twilight movie made me laugh more than anything simply because actors robert kristen not bad actors but way they talked i just couldnt take their love seriously peter facinelli who played carlisle cullen edwards father exactly how i pictured pulled best performance film worth watch absolutely if youre fan books otherwise i would say if you just wanna see movie i recommend matinée price because honestly i think i may have lost my hearing after weekend none stop screams crazed teens,5
Twilight,10may,7
Twilight,review may contain spoilers youve been warned twilight terrible film adaption lets face mediocre novel i went into theater open mind not expecting brilliance but expecting entertained well i guess i technically entertained since i laughed throughout most movie sadly i wasnt laughing purposely funny moments i laughing awkward acting actors terrible dialogue,4
Twilight,now where gets tricky do we blame screenwriter author movie made me realize just how corny books dialogue i found myself rolling my eyes when i wasnt laughing every word out actors mouth especially dialogue between edward bella now dialogue could have been over looked if actors were able deliver them alas whoever decided do casting film decided cast every actor acting ability toaster now toaster inanimate object therefore cannot act get hint what made me laugh hardest end movie when bellas mother decides inform phil via text message bella alright i so shocked she really texting him i turned my friend whispered bellas okay lol really though text messages i would think informing your potential spouse your childs well being would warrant phone call least,1
Twilight,now i have point out scene where edward decides flash bella goods he wants educate her ways vampire he cannot go out into sunlight not because hell burn turn dust but because he turns into failed childrens art project reading scene book i already knew whoever turned book into film going have issues scene however i really thought theyd aim something above spraying robert pattinson water then dumping craft store glitter him i didnt even notice sparkles first my friend turned me commented sun hits him he gets gross sweaty because lets face thats what he looked like damp dirty oh baby i can hardly contain myself i could go nit pick everything but im just going wrap up say movie awful im disappointed screenwriter well director i feel like hardwicke too focused making miseenscene beautiful aesthetically pleasing which all well good but doing so she over looked her cast actors who would probably get over looked high school play audition way they displayed their acting abilities movie though maybe i take back part being disappointed screenwriter since you can only do so much source material youre handed,1
Twilight,bring twilight fans i can take them shields maximum power,1
Twilight,just one persons opinion no need get angry fact id like you convince me im wrong,3
Twilight,movie missing magic edward appeared screen i swooned he opened his mouth i cringed edward strong confident he wasnt whiney smitten child love yes but brooding pain bella delicate not just dry indifferent bella lacked emotion maybe even soulwho she she didnt feel like yearning thoughtful bella i had imagined i wished she needed protected version can take care her own businessand im not sure how bad she wants edward why matter maybe if she narrated her emotions would have been more pronounced dont get me wrong actors chemistry very evident they should get married have melodramatic children but film bellas perspective not changing pov offputting film proves meyers pages pages what bring story edward bellas love life,4
Twilight,tone completely lost book script screen translation story supposed song takes you another world one where vampires werewolves exist story intoxicating melody here were presented boyband pop song sung kids who think themselves classically trained opera singers pick one charttopping americas top 40 haunting dangerous lullaby i think lot fans were looking,9
Twilight,speaking boy bandthe screen version jacob black one bye bye bye being lead singer overproducedaxewearingguygroup 2008 jacob my mind earthy hes guys guy gets his hands dirty fixing cars building stuff jacob always left me feeling like he wise beyond his years smitten kitten course but i always felt he more dynamic than cute little wigwearing version i always felt sense history quiet power version wears abercrombie randomly appears behind trees apparentlyyoull see,1
Twilight,cast quite ok me i did feel bad watching them try deliver lines they were given i get vampireromance movie but honestly script dripping gooey sticky melted mixed cheeses ok so its fantastical but slap me face gouda brie every other frame just insulting,3
Twilight,cheese aside charlie great his timing spot carlisle played part but cakedon white makeup so completely distracting esme i wanted crawl up onto her lap have her tell me bedtime stories love alice thats her screen little bouncier shes perfect jasper freakishly creepy pained loved when he comes out his shell plays more than wideeyed silent sidekick im all over those who doubted reed need reconsider rosalie freaking hot one sassy vamp emmettholy crap money call me jessica best casting job lifemike howeverreally,1
Twilight,i know just movie film different medium than books we get create world book but people get interpret us screen i know i just wish wasnt so far off base me i wanted nothing more than enjoy i think im going remember series way i imagined set version aside my oil canvas painting their polaroid,1
Twilight,whos melodramatic now girl,1
Twilight,heres hopping they make choice next one teen scene dark love story so audiences know what theyre getting into teenie boppers quite loyal perhaps bubblegum will beef up their box office,1
Twilight,preface review i read all four twilight books one weekend last weekend actually when i picked first one up airport could not put down i zipped through other three went midnight screening opening day say least i captivated twilight im my 20s,1
Twilight,i anxious see movie because like so many other people i felt really invested bella edwards story not only but i love vampire premise just never gets old especially when you put new spin meyer did her books events each book really ran together me so way i felt like nontwilighter coming into film i really didnt care if movie deviated book fact i kind hoping would since you cant expect book translate directly screen i heard lot serious twilight teens complaining about major things missing when i left theater but i honestly didnt notice any major omissions,1
Twilight,overall film better than i expected based previews i expected extremely cheesy lowbudget awkwardly filmed definitely grew me went especially pattinsons performance his introduction extremely awkward not sure if hardwickes fault pattinsons acting any case soon he settled into his character he absolutely captivating stewart plays great brooder she certainly did here i loved scenes her father my opinion these were some gems movie,2
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,after seeing so many scathing reviews i decided watch anyway covid times movie provides light relief chuckle here there i do forgive short comings film paul hogan portrays sense sadness which revolves around aging process gives film some merit few bitter sweet humorous moments like weaker marx brothers movies world better place they exist rather than not,6
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,didnt really know what expect when i started my account first selected movie what i can say im more pleasantly surprised how much i enjoyed cameos fantastic movie locations look superb its lot fun,8
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,look one long roast paul hogan gags funny movie sets good pace musical number true highlight,3
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,its comedy suitable whole family if just happens last movie paul hogan ever does well i can say hes gone out high note what hes done australia then good you mate,9
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,paul hogan aussie icon i have loved him since paul hogan show however absolute rubbish i feel embarrassed paul i cant understand why he other well known aussie actors would lower their standards participating poorly thought out train wreck i turned off half way through not wanting taint my opinion such aussie legend retire gracefully paul you dont need do crap like disappointed,7
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,i loved trailer movie what hooked me into watching i anticipated wold good i wasnt disappointed i thought fun lighthearted movie several giggles has some great messages especially last scene i thought paul too looked awesome 79 nice seeing so many cameos,10
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,i would love paul make another movie he still has,8
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,lots humor pauls expense cool cameos many jokes wellwritten effective i liked john cleese especially hilarious,6
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,great film if you read what message says one side world worships you then wants destroy you if you dont fit film i would highly recommend those who want see good fun some honesty about how older generations get tried tribulated media they once served money,7
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,what wonderful light hearted comedy i nice swan song hogan not taking life seriously great family movie,8
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,being long time paul hogan fan great see him back top form pokes jabs hollywood system fun playful when watching someone his 80s roll his eyes community self obsessed materialistic clutching keep itself alive relevent however all moments where hoges shines its woeful costars particularly his manager make so cringe worthy some terrible acting terrible green screen work strange editing make go possible 8 soso six,4
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,thank you hoges one isnt your fault,1
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,okay hoges 80 now so those expecting him funny his heyday expecting too much being said movie still very funny because he plays situations hes placed well frankly hes still got my opinion whoever wrote directed deserve praise too some probably dont like current politics played laughs but its hardly something hasnt been done before random person goofball stuffing up being falsely accused becoming social pariah i laughed lot so thats main thing,3
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,not academy award material but lot laughs mr dundee like deer headlights kind role bad things kept happening him despite fact he kept trying do right thing meanwhile reporters kept coming down him hard one wild scene after another watch laughs dont get serious,3
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,paul hogan stars slapdash comedy where beloved australian icon being awarded knighthood services comedy nominations must have closed prior release date standout performance 90 minute masterpiece definitely jar vegemite its smooth ability onscreen presence unrivalled its costars hoges course fine form still loveable larrikin we know him,10
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,i didnt have high hopes time there were no ratings reviews imdb so i though id check out,8
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,paul hogan plays paul hogan trying resurrect his acting career i love hoges but nothing even remotely amusing had happened third way through 90 minute film dont let impressive cameos fool you atrocious i cant even see who aimed kids adults looking dose 80s nostalgia,2
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,please dont even bother,1
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,movie didnt need happen should avoided,1
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,end film i left feeling there no apparent story plot drive film along there some funny bits pieces other actors sadly drudge watch perhaps paul needs cheer up bit join,2
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,comedian turned filmmaker paul hogan earned his 1987 best original screenplay oscar nomination crocodile dundee film shows he still has goods my mate brent thinks im just being nostalgic making up good review laugh but he wrong wrong wrong,8
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,tribute hogans original work little course bit edge but never apologizing what which dose humour whether we like admit not makes us laugh,2
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,does exceptional job holding mirror hypocrisy modern day television stardom especially hollywood provides ironically save platform big names put their signature clear deserved critique culture would easily castrate them doing so any other venue,1
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,smart writing will rattle few cages deserve rattled,4
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,i have been long time hoges fan but movie mediocre best depressing only good bits last 5 minutes definitely no crocodile dundee,2
How Do You Know,im currently watching film honestly its so bizarre these all incredible actors but film i just dont know what happening however i cannot stop watching i just need understand what hell going what aim dialogue between characters all over place not sure if its supposed humourous not either way im not laughing but then again i am because its such ridiculous film lol even review sounds so scrambled because what film doing lol,4
How Do You Know,winter i alone home i anticipating there will no wifi couple days so i had some movies downloaded my netflix seeing owen wilson paul rudd cast i thought movie would rom com but i start watching i found out its romantic drama lots life lessons i am lucky there no internet connection afternoon its movie i am gonna suggest everyone who having bad day i am gonna watch again,7
How Do You Know,looking casting you would immediately think romantic comedy i guess thats where starts going wrong people going see movie expecting chick flick being disappointed,7
How Do You Know,i believe reason poor reviews movie due fact has been advertised delivered romantic comedy,7
How Do You Know,true fit romance genre comedy not so much but far romantic dramas go excellent picture modernized crowd,10
How Do You Know,thats because so much more ideal viewing well intended inspiring somewhatromantic movie humour few far between comedyseeking crowd however those who connect characters humour purely intended those devised caring characters,4
How Do You Know,reese witherspoon has perfected role lisa movie i would beg girlfriends watch due her total delivery character throughout entire picture which something most girls women can relate whether theyve reached hurdle yet not,8
How Do You Know,which where i feel script originated life lessons script movie all relatable one aspect other its moving view capture these life lessons within movie i think if movie can deliver then they have succeeded making good movie although writing could have been sharper better presented wittier decent enough one indulged plot,7
How Do You Know,paul rudd i thought fantastic casting again writing could been better few his lines where comedy intended some his reactions but still i found him excellent i enjoyed watching him,8
How Do You Know,nice see jack nicholson again huge fan one flew over cuckoos nest his part suitable if not little long winded i felt again wittier writing would have improved his character performance hugely however he delivered his part,10
How Do You Know,luke wilson okay so we all know what kind movies hes known now fair enough he good casting part my only itch id like see him doing more roles similar hutch ala starsky dry detective types,9
How Do You Know,moving said above not movie make you lol rofl merely movie enjoyed watching these characters journey selfrevelations throughout,6
How Do You Know,i expecting very disappointed film because id heard most people disliked i really really liked i think audiences these days have have joke every 30 seconds entertained maybe audiences feel short changed if there isnt huge obvious wrap up off plot end film i liked everything wasnt black white film there many unanswered questions characters intentions feelings werent absolutely clear thats what i loved about,9
How Do You Know,its sad so many people disliked film but i think its very courageous james l brooks write film pleased him not have pace like most other successful hollywood crap movies film makes you think unlike many other huge hit comedies these days,10
How Do You Know,when i first saw trailer how do you know i thought looked like promising rom com but then i saw initial reviews steered clear away wasnt until my uncle pushed me didnt tank yeah but its actually good i think reason why movie got such bad reviews people expected typical rom com i did what real movie depth great characters smart dialogue complexity reality some jokes love story thrown great writing superb acting dont know what else say found intriguing further review my go critics didnt review one one better films ive seen year would give 8 but right wrong giving 10,10
How Do You Know,greetings again darkness how about little effort folks writerdirector james l brooks jack nicholson have teamed up three far superior films prior terms endearment broadcast news good gets all insightful dramadies bring real life into relationships billed romcom but romance distant lame comedy all but nonexistent,2
How Do You Know,very talented paul rudd plays george son charles nicholson who target federal investigation after his father sets him up falsifying corporate financial documents problem george really nice honest guy charles lying scumbag who would throw his son federal wolves,1
How Do You Know,seemingly unrelated story reece witherspoon plays lisa very talented softball player incredible track record evidently serious skills she gets cut olympic team because her advancing age she will 31 next olympics lisa dating matty played owen wilson matty 14 million per year major league baseball player who also player off field,1
How Do You Know,everyone story so very nice but screwed up their own way thats actually hopeful start so one thing leads another george falls lisa lisa moves matty who lives charles building lisa then moves out george always there lisa while her life shambles georges life shambles too but all he cares about lisa any guess how ends up course you know script not built surprises romance comedy,4
How Do You Know,bulk comedy comes very pregnant kathryn hahn anne whose life also bit mess she unmarried pregnant assistant george who worries about him her everything but she has such big heart she bakes labels multiple dinners george,7
How Do You Know,anyway best part film we never get subjected owen wilson throwing pitch reese witherspoon actually playing softball there so much talent associated film but definitely proves point heart film not direction acting but script similar story line but far superior film go rewatch when harry met sally eighteenth time has comedy romance worthy script,8
How Do You Know,i am very critical slow pacing but did not find comedy least bit slow one who works wall street i can tell you people like george actually do exist promoted position authority due nepotism but set up fall because he actually has ethics i thought way they set things up phone call reba pragmatic selfishness his current girlfriend nondate date worked well together plausible enough within context enjoyable i also thought relationship between jockplayer wilson overthehill jock witherspoon sweet funny its own way,10
How Do You Know,however kathryn hahn steals every scene shes rudds personal assistant who hates whats going also single momtobe her scene hospital alone worth price admission me ending also well handled best paul rudd performance i have seen since shape things after many bad ones inbetween witherspoon fine even though she didnt seem have sizzling chemistry rudd she wonderful wilson cameo shalhoub psychiatrist hilarious marklinn baker appropriately cowering corporate lawyer nicholson fine he felt part even though he could have played his sleep not one his best but more than adequate,7
How Do You Know,so original groundbreaking film no highly enjoyable romantic comedy good supporting performances funny scenes yes,2
The Green Mile,i expected movie normal i just want see tom hanks but movie goes through i cryi laugh there comes feeling which cant described words i rate movie best i have ever seen some moments movie makes me hold my bed pillow tightest ever grip i can guarantee movie will leave impression your mind long time i even say movie better than shawshank redemptionfantastic story brilliant actingmind boggling feelings overall unforgettable drama if you have watched 1000 movies not then your movie watching journey incompletei will also make sure even my next generation should watch one,10
The Green Mile,green mile one my favorite stephen king books i have read several times i anxiously anticipating film version but concerned emotional impact book could not replicated screen fortunately wonderful story adapted frank darabont who did such magnificent job bringing kings shawshank redemption screen he does same high quality work green mile story faithful book only losing details were not important story anyway casting superb every actor perfectly suited his role does excellent job although i would like single out doug hutchison his portrayal detestable percy right mark suggests complexities character i had not discovered book length about three hours seems critics complaining about i cant understand complaints film never drags never dull certainly didnt feel three hours long length needed tell story way should told story so very engrossing best all darabont actors bring so much emotion ot screen i cried like baby through several scenes green mile will haunt you,10
The Green Mile,green mile masterwork film art its very best depth cast extraordinary all players delivering excellent performances there clear sense here all involved production knew something special gave their all see film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything their craft watch countless subtleties expression great power cast creates silence evident opening sequence remains throughout above all michael duncan john coffey exceptional he brings gripping emotion unique fascinating character,10
The Green Mile,green mile should bring you joy laughter if you like most theater night tears,10
The Green Mile,bravo,10
The Green Mile,having seen movie green mile read novel same name stephen king i am glad say movie stays true book which itself great read i read book one setting about year ago after seeing movie i didnt see one scene book one plot point left out there were few minor changes book but which no way detract either work far performances i can imagine many people pointing michael duncan john coffey tom hanks paul edgecomb best performances movie they good but i would hope michael jeter would receive recognition portraying eduard delacroix he plays delacroix exactly i pictured him when i read book i can very well see why king himself said his favorite movies adapted his novels only one played out he had written i wouldnt compare movie book rita hayworth shawshank redemption because would unfair both they both great but both different green mile isnt movie about hope friendship shawshank redemption movie about miracle man people he affects but like shawshank redemption i give green mile 4 out 4 stars great story great cast great look,10
The Green Mile,frank darabont returns directors chair another adaptation stephen kings novel events take place death row guards call green mile story layered rather characterdriven fantasy tale events transpire mile after arrival giant man john coffey michael duncan convicted murder two small girls actually not one single story but several tied together seamlessly,10
The Green Mile,characterdriven movie requires lot cast fortunately when comes cast green mile delivers poster movie tells movie stars tom hanks paul edgecomb senior prison guard mile always he performs very well indeed yet cast around him even more spectacular perhaps partially due them being relatively unknown face you know one inevitably remembers previous performances new role coloured doug hutchison percy wetmore mean spirited prison guard particularly impressive yet his character could have been given more depth most captivating performance michael duncan,10
The Green Mile,hard find flaw movie camerawork superb cast wonderful direction flawless movies considerable length bit over three hours something had me worried yet marvellous cast peaceful yet firm pace movie held my attention progressively through three hours right touching culmination many will find movie too long but i one delighted style combination simplicity events depth characters conversation,10
The Green Mile,all all green mile very touching drama joys sorrows life pictured great skill if not best movie year five out five,10
The Green Mile,theres reason why oscar winning tour de force 67 ranked all films imdb despite fact its 3 hours long has some truly grisly scenes not squeamish children first date,10
The Green Mile,its chock full outstanding performances not only hanks but also many supporting characters all who rich full will seem slow impatient but will richly rewarding those stamina make end,10
The Green Mile,will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment perhaps different shadesdegrees evil either deeply moving spiritual tale wonderfully creepy journey down rabbit hole stephen kings mind take your pick either way i put right up there my desert island list likes shawshank redemption definitely required watching,10
The Green Mile,some supporting characters little twodimensional but green mile incredibly effective prison drama terrific performances script deals grief innovative emotionally resonant way,10
The Green Mile,green mile 1999,8
The Green Mile,starring tom hanks david morse michael clarke duncan bonnie hunt james cromwell michael jeter doug hutchison gary sinise written directed frank darabont running time 180 minutes rated r scenes strong disturbing violence language some sexuality,9
The Green Mile,blake french,10
The Green Mile,its not everyday movie able change audiences opinion something green mile movie made me think long hard about supporting death penalty film based novel stephen king contains such variety emotional events repels its audience away its subject rather than glamorizing only handful recent productions have been capable such power green mile truly one best films year oscar worthy many categories unique three hour experience must seen believe,10
The Green Mile,story more personal narrative than actual plot film offers interesting perspective events take place seen through eyes man who over one hundred years age paul edgecomb who currently living old folks home his friend elaine during very emotional day paul he tells elaine historical year his experiences she listens closely his story,10
The Green Mile,he tells particular year 1930s setting beautifully crafted prison hall paul explains he used kind prison guard death row charge overseeing executions year several significant activities occurred his life he had terribly painful urinary infection met prisoner named john coffey man has been sentenced electric chair rape murder two innocent little girls man isnt like anyone else paul has seen however aside being massive size he humble mild mannered caring after several miraculous events take place may point thought john coffey might have magical powers god paul begins doubt crimes so called criminal has been convicted,10
The Green Mile,throughout story we witness three executions electric chair these capital punishment sequences have much power significance electrocutions one particular contain some most unsettling disturbing material film history movie anti death penalty we see sometimes sadistic world prisoner guards point view will put you their shoesand perhaps change your opinion death penalty i certainly had think about my stand issue,10
The Green Mile,i did have questions were not really answered filmmakers i wanted more john coffeys magical powers miracles arent investigated enough suit our pleas i think movie could have also stood firmer platform religion we assume coffeys abilities gift god characters dialogue but religion itself more theme film than message plot point i can perfectly see why writers decided leave these elements audiences imagination provoke participation so i suppose my objections not really flaws just personal aspirations,10
Avengers: Infinity War,movie portrays villain far has been best out all other marvel antagonists shows his personal conflicts his purpose well his cruelty heroes film overshadowed but ending really makes mark audience,9
Avengers: Infinity War,film way better than endgame actions better writings better dialogues better cgi better more shocks more emotional watching both cinema reactions cinema unbelievable compared endgame dont get me wrong endgame good but say its best marvel film jus marvel fan boys being stupid i just dont see how people saying endgame best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than but trust me film changed mcu lol maybe because i wanted them lose because thanos badass,10
Avengers: Infinity War,movie beginning culmination marvels masterfully woven cinematic universe beginning back 2008 iron man we finally seeing results all movies have been pointing did not disappoint thanos complex villain deeper more interesting desires than just world domination dilemmas all characters face movie both heroes villains truly thought provoking leave you edge your seat no other set movies has beeen so involved so expanded encompassed so many story linescharacters previous movies sheer amount star power alone film insane they do masterful job weaving all these unique various characters into common storyline,10
Avengers: Infinity War,i consider myself big comic book marvel fan my favorite films franchise so far cap american winter soldier thor ragnarok movie directed same guys winter soldier civil war i went into movie skyhigh expectations,10
Avengers: Infinity War,i am gonna keep brief avengers infinity war blew me away if i should mention just one thing really amazed me character thanos he so well developed makes super interesting complex villain audience we actually capable sympathizing guy who wants kill off half universe its not about power dominance its about preserving life universe finite resources goal leads him avengers into several interesting moral dilemmas,10
Avengers: Infinity War,i agree other reviews here movie such beautiful calamity 10 years best superhero entertainment there thinking about i cant really grasp how director pulled off so many well developed characters different story lines working together true cinematic symphony,10
Avengers: Infinity War,i give movie my highest recommendations its mustsee anyone just remote interest franchise,9
Avengers: Infinity War,over past decade marvel has earned itself benefit doubt studio has consistently delivered smart funny brave films both embrace transcend their comicbook origins 18 blockbuster movies produced since iron man first blasted off into stratosphere 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films genre theyve helped legitimise indeed marvels two most recent films thor ragnarok black panther have received kind accolades usually reserved edgy arthouse flicks,9
Avengers: Infinity War,yet its perfectly reasonable apprehensive about avengers infinity war blockbuster film thats been ten years making its plot hinted scattered throughout 18 other movies features 30 so characters each their own complex backstories motivations all them coming together bid stop giant purple alien dude destroying universe sounds ridiculous feels impossible,10
Avengers: Infinity War,but thats precisely what makes final product such monumental achievement masterfully directed anthony joe russo infinity war bold brainy filmmaking its very best kind will lift your spirits blow your mind shatter your soul occasionally same scene demonstrates epic scale what marvel has known all along special effects tightly choreographed action there serve story all its blockbuster spectacle theres almost too much film works because its anchored heart humour humanity its characters,10
Avengers: Infinity War,films basic plot simple thanos played via motioncapture josh brolin intergalactic purveyor death destruction has long been hunt six infinity stones will give him complete control over elemental building blocks universe he dispatches his acolytes earth retrieve time stone currently possession dr stephen strange benedict cumberbatch carve mind stone out forehead vision paul bettany its literal existential threat so terrifying all heroes weve come know love avengers guardians galaxy must put aside their differences unite against common foe,10
Avengers: Infinity War,outset its immediately clear neither films directors nor screenwriters christopher markus stephen mcfeely interested playing safe most other superhero films bled high stakes hero title might suffer untold trauma but its supersafe bet he she will make end alive theres no such guarantee here within first ten minutes we confronted dark twisted depths which thanos his acolytes black order will sink order achieve their goals death well genuine loss sacrifice intrinsic narrative drumbeat drives infinity war ever forward film all better,10
Avengers: Infinity War,thats not say movie morbid depressing experience whats so impressive about infinity war how expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones moods when its funny very often its deeply truly funny film finds maximum joy flinging characters together merry abandon mixing matching ones youd never have expected share scenes trade banter peter quill chris pratt floored thors chris hemsworth godly muscles bruce banner mark ruffalo charmed wit intelligence shuri letitia wright itd impossible not utterly delighted peter dinklages inspired cameo its blithely tongueincheek sensibility shared marvels best comic books which understand humour can make you care when really counts,9
Avengers: Infinity War,boy does infinity war make count there many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout film charming surrogate fatherson dynamic shared tony stark robert downey jr peter parker tom holland undeniable love ties vision wanda maximoff elizabeth olsen together many ways film stands testament human capacity not just love but love fiercely beyond all logic its right there when unfailingly noble steve rogers chris evans declares we dont trade lives even when giving up one could save billions,9
Avengers: Infinity War,theres even chilling echo thanos himself lesser film would have turned thanos into onedimensional villain much way hes all monster maniac comic books infinity war however thanos end goal surprisingly relevant when comes thinking talking about staggeringly overpopulated world which we live today there turns out method thanos madness makes tragic twists turns his relationships his estranged adopted daughters gamora zoe saldana nebula karen gillan all more unsettling,9
Avengers: Infinity War,most part infinity war does justice too many heroes who have been assembled film russo brothers displayed great skill interweaving multiple perspectives character trajectories captain america civil war they do so again here twice many characters even most minor supporting players like don cheadles james rhodeswar machine given story beats land helps marvel has always taken care cast genuinely good actors roles might otherwise come off silly slight,10
Avengers: Infinity War,even so there few standouts amongst enormous enormously talented cast emotionally speaking downeys film he plays every note tonys reluctant courage bonedeep trauma he embarks what hes convinced suicide mission hes ably matched cumberbatch who finds vulnerability even his characters most cunning calculative move hemsworth meanwhile given free rein import bighearted comedic swagger thor ragnarok into film while also layering deeplyfelt jagged grief losses he has suffered hands thanos universe,9
Avengers: Infinity War,film so many moving parts some elements dont work quite well couple characters you might have expected right forefront including original avenger two fade into background film tumbles dizzying fight scene dizzying fight scene while most them fantastically choreographed there some purely dumb moments literally revolve around attempts prevent thanos clenching his fist effect superhero mêlée thats part overthetop part overkill might prove too much those who dont already care franchise characters,7
Avengers: Infinity War,minor quibbles aside though infinity war yet another step right direction marvel continues studios tradition placing premium rich complex storytelling respects both its characters its audiences but also refuses make things easy itself film ends even more bravely than began final ten minutes will haunt horrify you equal measure its stroke bold brilliant genius narrative risk so audacious youll want follow marvel wherever goes next,7
Avengers: Infinity War,summer movies often hype themselves spectacular events not missed their ad campaigns use words like epic spectacle smash ways build hype increase advanced box office sales summer 2018 film season kicks off big way avengers infinity war rare summer film exceeds lofty expectations delivers crowning achievement marvel cinematic universe when thanos josh brolin embarks deadly campaign find possess infinity stones he leaves path death destruction his path when his pursuit leading him earth bruce banner mark ruffalo doctor strange benedict cumberbatch who enlist reluctant tony stark robert downey jr cause just minions thanos arrive avengers fractured scattered following events captain america civil war teams find themselves dealing threat various groups fate steps divide many key members team allows great entry guardians galaxy allows film take very enjoyable path essentially movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive very satisfying epic you have story guardians well one many key avengers well others characters old new such like guardians avengers marvel film all rolled into one each one supports other very well yet has charm identity you would expect while tone very dark you would expect literally half known universe facing destruction there also some solid humor film never once undermines story pacing naturally effects stunning you would expect marvel has put significant amount money into film shows every eyepopping action sequence what really impressed me most russo brothers never let fx film overshadow characters very large cast nice see everyone got their moment you did not see members cast trying one up each other there some real surprise moments along way action easily best any marvel film date many fans had expressed disappointment avengers age ultron me film significantly better than prior film everything marvel fan would want film i also surprised how well thanos portrayed while you hopefully will not agree his deductions methods you could actually understand his motivations help him transcend usual megalomaniacs which so common films his type i am really looking forward seeing what comes next make sure you stay through credits bonus scene believe hype avengers infinity war epic not missed example what summer event film should 5 stars out 5,9

Avengers: Infinity War,i amazed see so many negative reviews so many people impossible please movie 2 12 hours long but i could have sat there another 2 12 hours not noticed thoroughly entertaining i love how directors werent afraid take chances ive read lot other user reviews claim theres no plot unless youre mentally handicapped not paying attention because youre your phone entire movie plot pretty clear decent my opinion,10
Avengers: Infinity War,infinity war does brilliant job seamlessly combining last few films together picks up where ragnarok left off space shuttle thor loki hulk all remaining asgardians opens distress call thanos his dark order have slaughtered most passengers including some remaining asgardians he interrogates thor beats hulk so bad he too scared ever turn green again defeated hulkbruce banner then transported doctor stranges sanctum sanctorum so he can warn him thanos arrival down doctor strange wong tony stark spider man prevent thanos evil minions destroying new york taking time stone its thrilling action sequence introduces starks cool new nanobot armour creates its own swords shields,10
Avengers: Infinity War,thanos has been teased since 2012 wait has paid off here he far one best villains story more about him achieving his goals which refreshing see villains normally sidelined these films he so determined get all six gems each gem making him stronger avengers guardians have race against time stop him finding all six one sequence his home planet titan worth mentioning like most film breathtaking tense his crew dark order also seem unbeatable they battle rest avengers wakanda their alien army which also proves difficult thanos gets some interesting backstory would have been even better if menacing dark order got some backstory themselves we never really understand them their motivations,5
Avengers: Infinity War,even though enters familiar ground often done differently most time its unpredictable its full surprises twists which will leave you exhausted end although infinity war feels over stuffed characters storylines russo brothers do exceptional job giving each character enough do its great see some focus characters like gamora thor previous films have kept prominently characters iron man hulk captain america thats not say they dont get anything do because they do its just not much usual entry really does require you see all ones before can become confusing they often call back previous events storylines so its better experience if you familiar all them there also so many fun references like rocket racoons need artificial limbs thors new haircut draxs constant quips,3
Avengers: Infinity War,there too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects cgi shots dont look bad but sometimes they can distracting however its technique quicker than any other studio films scale thats just small price pay action scenes so well directed accompanied music score alan silvestri who always adds extra level excitement them relief say infinity war runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which longest marvel film there no point saying its baggy overlong fans franchise will greatly appreciate so much going runtime justified,4
X-Men: Apocalypse,suffering bizarre narrative choices weak character development xmen apocalypse otherwise passable occasionally great installment franchise mainly due continued strong performances glorious action set pieces,7
X-Men: Apocalypse,xmen apocalypse sequel days future past takes place about decade later 80s movie entertained me start finish i cant say i ever bored but there lot things i not satisfied while watching starting off good magneto professor x continue best parts these movies michael fassbender magneto amazing he has really emotional scene towards beginning which got me locked into film james mcavoy also great xavier internal battles inside xaviers head were riveting i really liked new cast younger xmen like jean grey storm nightcrawler cyclops quicksilver has another awesome scene just like previous movie action handled very well most part first half movie terrific but second half brings down apocalypse villain ok me some scenes worked well others didnt i always skeptical oscar isaac apocalypse i still dont think he best choice he just like jesse eisenberg lex luthor me apocalypse also small mutant compared others some reason hes just another villain who obsessed destroying world his motivations thin jennifer lawrence boring mystique she just seems uninspired throughout runtime becomes tedious since she uses personality over over again play character some mutants were completely wasted here psylocke angel theres entire sequence secret lab seemed there only one reason cameo specific person while fun watch didnt do much anything story long run entire thing could have been removed movie would have been same final battle felt underwhelming whole global extinction problem they dont show any civilians dying its just buildings coming apart making hard care about situation overall xmen apocalypse disappointing sequel first class days future past but not all bad movie magneto professor x once again great apocalypse mixed bag pacing movie all over place dull second half just brings film down really good first half xmen apocalypse gets b,7
X-Men: Apocalypse,i personally thought days future past best series turns out apocalypse worst one date,3
X-Men: Apocalypse,only bright spot all awfulness quicksilver whose slomo scene least good previous movie if not better other than everything else goes mediocre outright terrible,8
X-Men: Apocalypse,main villains motivation bland stupid yeah he just wants kill everyone rule world way he persuades other mutants join him absolutely unbelievable he basically just offers increase mutants power return demands help kill billions people sounds like fair deal whats offputting extent which he augments his followers powers not constant like magneto gains power control pretty much all metal planet once while psylocke gains another special effect her cgi laser beams whatever she emits apocalypses abilities general largely undefined times he shown pulling matter objects around him construct something then next shot he just makes solid objects like armor out thin air another ridiculous thing they tried make isaac more intimidating giving him thick soles so hed look taller which noticeable what more his lines cringeworthy but problem so everyone elses same boring cliché dialogues like its your home we will help join us eric i see good you,7
X-Men: Apocalypse,yeah forgiving magneto like its nothing after he helps kill millions people destroy entire cities included package also he changes his mind about whole destroy world thing after mystique tells him 100th time he her family she still sees good him,7
X-Men: Apocalypse,some characters looks still beyond ugly i can actually see why they chose try keep beast mystique their human forms more except saving actors extensive makeup procedures thing these characters look absolutely goddamn atrocious painful watch i mean lawrence annoying redundant when she screen anyway but when she also blue just becomes vomitinducing,10
X-Men: Apocalypse,recent 2016 comicbook blockbusters also did not enjoy good scripts but least they had highquality gripping action scenes not case here fighting mostly goofy bland times clearly visible actors motions they being pulled strings being drawn cheap cgi,7
X-Men: Apocalypse,actually sad singers previous movie dotfp outstanding recent deadpool who ostensibly shares universe xmen awesome now we get horrible outrageously stupid pretentious cgoverdosed mess lets hope next one will better,7
X-Men: Apocalypse,there very little surprised me about quality movie i knew would step down dofp but would likely still have good story few problems some problems were not sort i expected heightened stakes proved less issue than i expected held back some emotional appeal but not much characters ended up being more problem than i had hoped which too bad because other two requels did really good job character development,1
X-Men: Apocalypse,case there were few too many characters too give them proper depth i suppose returning characters were good charles erik were very engaging you knew where their philosophies were charles got kind cool time around rather than just wise eriks feeling entitlement his rage brought new level other returning characters moira hank raven peter were pretty good great see little more quicksilver action i thought hank felt more natural time around raven little forced but not much id feared her prominence trailer however new characters were big problem they werent very well introduced didnt really make you want root them three lesser horsemen were hardly given any attention even new protagonists were very poorly developed i suppose some can accounted their being original three but still didnt turn out good course we cant forget our villain apocalypse who interesting more ways than might expected i afraid we might get flat villain but his motive actually pretty good i really liked how he abhorred tools especially when he got rid all cold war nukes robbing his enemy weapons rather than using those weapons himself revealed so much about his value natural power ego,7
X-Men: Apocalypse,story whole decent but some scenes were excellent i loved opening transference apocalypse magneto losing his family also done really well along his subsequent recruitment apocalypse climax also pretty good fashion which apocalypse defeated while felt little clichéd still felt plausible thematic however entire sequence col strykers base wolverine everything totally unnecessary made sense he would capture mutants point but space could have been filled much better,7
X-Men: Apocalypse,visuals were topnotch which expected quicksilver scene probably best spfx scene overall script did decent job dialogue but didnt do very well shifting focus between different groups characters right pace acting returning roles good but new faces gave some flat performances i particularly unimpressed sophie turner jean grey,1
X-Men: Apocalypse,theme mutants fitting rest society not touched upon very much here comes up bit hank ravens conversation stage fight between angel nightcrawler there more focus controlling unleashing abilities mostly jean scott but its rarely addressed however way apocalypse amplifies his followers powers rather interesting exception angel he really just tells them you have so much undiscovered potential let me show you how tap into,1
X-Men: Apocalypse,so youve probably already heard its not best xmen movies but doesnt make bad if you think youll want see some point go catch now while its still theaters rather than waiting watching your computer free its definitely movie you want see big screen you should see least first class dofp first because events both referenced there couple flashbacks them well there only couple references original movies pretty much just wolverine cameo so if allusions like would you prefer yellow spandex annoy you dont worry too much if you hate savetheworld plots better than most but still has most prototypical elements overall rating 8410,7
X-Men: Apocalypse,i loved all xmen movies including xmen origins wolverine i so hyped when i heard they were creating xmen movie apocalypse i have always loved superhero movies about end days i will say specific parts i loved thought about film how i would recommend,2
X-Men: Apocalypse,how good movie may not top previous xmen movies but doesnt mean movie terrible all based opinion dont scared see movie all because critics making movie look bad go see yourself your own opinion you decide whether movie good not my opinion actually good not great but good,10
X-Men: Apocalypse,younger versions xmen film yes we have younger version cyclops jean nightcrawler storm we also have many amazing recurring members previous movies such young professor x who amazing slight older magneto mystique who also little older beast who still young ever yes quicksilver returns tops his amazing scene xmen days futures past,8
X-Men: Apocalypse,how apocalypse character honestly i feel apocalypse little weaker than his comic version if he cgi like thanos guardians galaxy he wouldve looked more threatening tyrannical i could basically compare apocalypse wimp who cosplays apocalypse really good make up his role almost similar ultron,7
X-Men: Apocalypse,wolverine yes he may have small cameo but damn excellent cameo when wolverine enters screen film basically transforms into rrated action scene now who wolverine also based real weapon x origin wolverine he acts like wild animal slashes anyone who gets his way even guy who begged wolverine mercy got his face ripped off,8
X-Men: Apocalypse,how dark film actually pretty dark there lot death depressing moments you will feel we also get more connected magneto why he hates humanity so much almost felt he main antagonist film we see his past his present why he turned into dark yet powerful supervillain also way apocalypse murders people pretty brutal frightening,10
X-Men: Apocalypse,would you recommend course like i said may not top previous xmen films but doesnt mean terrible if you love xmen well apocalyptic superhero movies then film you go see,1
X-Men: Apocalypse,xmen apocalypse very fun but got quite messy parts xmen fans will like just like i did huge step down days future past has pretty clichéd villain i forgave clichéd villain because how cool how frightening he oscar isaac did so good apocalypse characters well developed but some them do not get enough screen time some get much angel psyloche storm have no motivation there no reason why they agreed help apocalypse destroy world what would they gain overall i thought movie good i had blast watching will watching again,9
X-Men: Apocalypse,okay already fourth superhero film we have gotten so far year fact its good blows my mind its sixth entry main xmen series might third best after x2 days future past oscar isaac gives outstanding performance mutant menace apocalypse he highlight film right next fassbenders magneto who never fails deliver year pathetic disappointing superhero film villains so far apocalypse gives us layered threatening performance we want our villains evan peters returns quicksilver once more give us amazing scene tops one days future past newcomers fantastic exciting we will certainly see them again future they also finally got cyclops right forget about rotten tomatoes go see film opening weekend you wont regret,1
X-Men: Apocalypse,you can probably gather i thought another very good addition xmen franchise whilst doesnt hit heady heights days future past still really good watch i fail see why has had mixed press,1

Little Women,some comments lament movie has changed book especially ending i heard greta gerwig interview today where she explained she studied louisa may alcott found out alcott actuality pressured her publishers marry jo end book gerwig wanted honor alcott ending way really meant knowledge made movie so much better me,10
Little Women,review coming someone who doesnt know book never seen any other little women movie i completely fell love story its simplicity emotional twists drama performances fantastic talk about cast probably one best 2019 since meryl streep emma watson timothée chalamet florence pugh laura dern saoirse ronan even chris cooper looks good movie future hollywood very well preserved all talent so young already so well established industry eliza too loved all performances specially saiorse who gives such brilliant performance goes beyong supporting actress costume design always so beautiful cinematography gorgeous saying gerwig overlooked understatement everything she did nominated except herself hope does well oscars but if not remains one my favorite movies 2019,8
Little Women,film simply spectacular acting superb everone cast attention detail here just breathtaking i wondering during film how much time effort were into making movie,8
Little Women,i bit annoyed nonlinearity script thought overdone but besides i enjoyed film lot go see,8
Little Women,greta gerwig my estimation one most brilliant female scriptwritersfilm directors currently making movies her version alcotts classic novel spellbinding she adroitly juxtapositions several years span between year composing publication her 1868 book civil war years home when novels events took place i am also appreciative yorick le sauxs plush cinematography what duo gerwig french photographer made produce one most gorgeous period pieces many moon,5
Little Women,two minor complaints casting timothee chalet love interest two sisters hes portrayed young wastrel whose apathy somehow attracts two into wanting marry another alcott had writing success writing under nom de plume am bernard before composing little women detail totally ignored,9
Little Women,otherwise outstanding film surprised even guy who went his wifes insistence,8
Little Women,going back forth too much little more chronology would have been better my opinion,8
Little Women,so writerdirector snubbed oscars industry wonders why audience no longer there its because people wont pay your high prices crap you producing few really good films were even nominated oscar so keep producing films only others hollywood will go see you will go broke now film like another reviewer i have never read book seen previous movies but i really enjoyed movie my only complaint because constant change time like all other movies use method transition story hard follow i must say actress playing lead laura dern superb i have long been love laura dern now even more so i also am love emma watson but very disappointed her performance im so glad i saw her beauty beast,3
Little Women,little women classic story four march sisters growing learning about world together northeastern united states during 19th century we have jo saoirse ronan strongwilled writer meg emma watson softer more traditional sister beth eliza scanlen quiet one amy florence pugh spirited most immature marmie mother laura dern oversees girls while father war,8
Little Women,theyre charming bunch different their own way headstrong jo believes she has whole life thing figured out she often urges her sisters follow her suggestions which ounce urgency away becoming outright demands despite jos efforts each girl possesses gusto follow her own path ultimately they live lives they want lead little women,10
Little Women,greta gerwig delivers wonderful adaptation classic novel perhaps best date give her plenty credit work just make sure also credit actors theyre all brilliant girls give outstanding performances does timothee chalamet theodore laurence boy next door girls everyone calls him laurie everyone except jo,9
Little Women,jo teddy she calls him share instant lifelong connection they love each other immediately always its clear day everyone only person who doesnt seem see jo focusing her writing drive show world women worth more than their appearance jo has no interest marriage love but story so two will have their chance,10
Little Women,here comes spoiler,9
Little Women,im sorry question writer such wonderful story but clear love between teddy jo why world do they not end up together movies version story attempts explain but fails miserably every scene teddy jo share two characters display magnetic chemistry rare kind nothing can keep them apart except unfathomable choice author novel jo turns down teddy who turns amy her hand marriage she says yes works well amy because she had always loved laurie she calls him but jo later so upset desperately lonely she immediately agrees date professor she met while teaching young writing students two get along fine just fine two get together after he shows up march home one day spends bit time family then leaves soon he walks out door rest family shouts jo she loves him should chase him what its laughably absurd there zero indication jo actually loves him i hate say because i liked movie very much but misstep story must called out jo teddy should together yes its predictable but its correct ending,10
Little Women,end spoiler,9
Little Women,gerwig makes beautiful film sagely including enough light moments complement heavy theme material makes up more movie than younger viewers might notice gerwig establishes fitting tone lighting style all elevating overall film all she does well she also makes one curious decision which sequence film completely out chronological order never totally works more often taking away story than improving choice one couple tiny blemishes preventing film being flawless,9
Little Women,anyone everyone little women worth seeing see others talk about afterwards itll well worth your time,9
Little Women,really well done didnt expect before going theatre but director has been able mix great performance all actors welldone screenplay not normal little woman personal version greta gerwig,10
Little Women,if you want see little women watch 1994 version perfectly cast had coherent plot line movie poorly cast lot roles back forth timeline confusing you gain zero empathy characters beths death blip barely any emotion i didnt shed tear chalamet unbelievable teddy he looks like hes perpetually 16 laura dern terrible choice marmee there no established love story between jo friedrich so when they get together its just silly 94 version not old enough unappealing younger audiences so well done cast acted monstrosity time energy fact got nominated best picture someones idea joke if you liked movie try 94 version tell me im wrong,10
Little Women,writerdirector greta gerwig tries her hand alcotts timeless semiautobiographical comingofage story spotlighting two different time periods lives indefatigable march sisters firstrate casting featuring ronan freespirited aspiring storyteller jo watson fashionable domestic meg pugh economical attentionseeking amy scanlen quiet musical beth their journey childhood young adulthood they pursue their individual hopes dreams during 1860s even though isnt direct page screen adaptation overlapping timelines can taxing times gerwig able stage many powerful scenes explore allimportant themes sexism loneliness friendship love unbreakable familial bonds thanks four fabulous leading ladies quality work chalamet cooper streep who invaluable key supporting roles,10
Little Women,finally saw little women 2019 didnt expected much cause i really liked 94 version gillian armstrong winona ryder gabriel byrne trini alvarado christian bale susan sarandon well casting something i cannot judge which one better both so so great but christian bale 94 i liked better than timothée chalamet 2019 although he good but didnt overcome christian,7
Little Women,two things really grabbed me,10
Uncut Gems,intense decided watch after seeing film pop up so many 2019 top 10 movies lists i couldnt happier i did adam sandler absolutely killed i kept feeling confused choices he made but same time felt sorry him,9
Uncut Gems,ending game though my palms were sweaty i edge my seat waiting see if going end badly like most gambling movies do i extremely surprised see him win his bet thinking wow movie actually going have happy ending but oh boy i shocked when sandler unlocked door my jaw ground,8
Uncut Gems,only thing keeping 10 ending felt incomplete whats his family going think whats his side piece gonna do once she came back his dead corpse either way movie amazing,9
Uncut Gems,edit wow did not expect so much hate film after reading other reviews not mention looks like users here fishing out positive reviews marking them all non helpful i dont know about those bad reviewers but any movie has me lost words pounding heart rate long deserves spot high up my list,10
Uncut Gems,all reviews here correct good ones bad ones movie mess you can like hate my wife hated i liked very much,10
Uncut Gems,his character unlikable its too loud its tiringstressful watch i fail see anything value any these critiques if anything proves director got exactly response he wanted tiring loud stressful even now after watching my blood pressure high my neck taught nerves but thats literally point not every film has center conventionally attractive hero progressing towards his goal after setback consequently fixing whatever romantic issues they had one moments made me love film even more howeys attempt reconcile his wife passover just moment they roped me into believing could classic sandler movie turning point where he grows person some way his significant other takes him back he didnt get chance here i love director instead generic turn around story we got see natural end his destructive tendencies may not feel good experience you went movies but doesnt make bad i think watching home good choice though i had take break middle film likely made all difference my ability enjoy,8
Uncut Gems,saw tiff front back movie might most stressful thing ive ever seen i huge fan good time movie ramps intensity even higher level sandlers performance great just shows time after time if hes working good directors strong supporting cast interesting concept he will absolutely crush also what other movie could have people watching sports most exhilarating part story,9
Uncut Gems,i also loved score daniel lopatin aka oneohtrix point never used super strategically build discomfort especially when swells drown out dialogue,3
Uncut Gems,looking forward watching again when gets wide release december,4
Uncut Gems,has been fascinating ride watching numerous ups downs adam sandlers career classic comedies like happy gilmore great dramatic performances like reign over me he has proven time time again he very talented guy problem he has let himself fall out spotlight over last ten years simply due fact he has been choosing some worst films each year multiple occasions what might greatest performance he has ever given uncut gems his latest role will released fall after viewing toronto international film festival giving little time sink i can confidently say will end up being one my favourite films 2019 years end,1
Uncut Gems,following jewelry store owner howard ratner adam sandler he gets his hands precious gemstone ethiopia he decides lend nba star good faith what sadly becomes apparent fact he has many issues under surface being really shady figure having serious gambling addiction ends up giving movie insane amount tension roller coaster ride claustrophobia i couldnt get enough,3
Uncut Gems,directors benny josh safdie have been quietly building solid little career themselves having worked very small indie projects like heaven knows what then one 2017s very best movies good time theyre truly duo industry needs their creativity always leaps off screen way feels very different other filmmakers working today movie heavily relies pacing editing performances screenplay requires nearly every performer constantly motion talking over one another movie barely gives you second catch breath,3
Uncut Gems,time third act begins youll probably wonder why you have been so invested sandlers portrayal howard because hes really not best person said its fact he terrible person deep down so greedy what made so engaging unnerving times use periodic psychedelic imagery pulsepoundingly superb score slew uberly talented performers uncut gems movie states very beginning its contender upcoming awards season,1
Uncut Gems,overall some viewers will absolutely wonder what point movie due nature how final few minutes play out but precisely these final moments took me off guard had me loving even more personally i feel audiences have become impatient films these days anything over hour half may seem like chore them if theyre not completely board so thats why i would recommend movie its not short but way movie put together makes fly i believe movie can appreciated many viewers uncut gems easily one years best films,1
Uncut Gems,they should hand out highgrade blood pressure meds people going see after ends major strength way slight weakness uncut gems how laserfocused safdies conveying total anxiety stress mania through extreme act full cinema sound levels acting overlapping dialog vangelisbladerunneronsteroidscrystal meth score some cinematography tracking camera,3
Uncut Gems,i do wish there little more than just flourishes relief though id lying if i said sandler anything but exceptional riveting playing degenerate crumbling right before our eyes while eric bogosian lakeith stanfield kevin garnett many others here natural solid its sandlers show its soulful tense harrowing ultimately terrible howard can tragic filmmakerss greatest achievement looks good time finding staractors who arent known their wide range getting careertriumph work them if movie isnt all complex i do think howard helps make pretty special depiction addiction more than anything else its got grit style burn which mostly fine me,4
Uncut Gems,uncut gems 2019 first things first not adam sandler movie yes he star focus advertising but very much safdie brothers film emphasis film benny josh safdie very much love look feel films 70s 80s particular but good time they not interested doing cutesy winkwink homage its their bones sandler plays howard new york city jeweler whos also fulltime hustler his marriage dinah idina menzel falling apart his gambling debts piling up he facing health issues he banks his future ethiopian rock which houses title valuables also involved twobit floozy hes carrying julia fox boston celtics legend kevin garnett playing himself getgo safdie brothers who also cowrote ronald bonstein bring enormous energy drive proceedings sandler starts 11 goes there similarly daniel lopatins score often mixed so high becomes intrusive times synth music itself isnt bad sort retro blend vangelis jeanmichel jarre darius khondijs 35mm photography both slick gritty director yorgos lanthimos favourite has remarked uncut gems like robert altman film dipped acid altmans 1974 california split certainly fits time period some themes course altman original many his admirers have found out over years overlapping dialogue naturalistic atmosphere do not alone make altman film altman himself often enough failed create unique mood uncut gems works because filmmaking brio sandlers driven performance still times seems trying too hard works best last act when safdies let drama play out more its good film even if not quite up good time but hey celtics fans now know how boston beat philadelphia 2012 playoff series,1
Uncut Gems,i am pretty sure would oscar nod sandler one thing i can say sure i have never been sandler fan i have deliberately avoided his movies all along i never liked him snl but boy did he break all my perceptions him gem not movie watch cinema sure watch leisure home possibly taking break two between intense will draw you,1
Uncut Gems,i went into film fairly high hopes yeah those hopes died about ten minutes everyone yelling practically every scene theres strange vaguely 80s sounding soundtrack blaring every scene first two acts mess though third act bit easier follow but ultimately doesnt offer all much story so sum up id rather watch billy madison while getting dental work done than trainwreck film,1
Uncut Gems,how even movie starters whos idea have constant loud atrocious outofplace annoying score almost every second film then putting bunch loud people one room yelling ignoring each other talking nonsense call movie garbage daily workplace stress people want avoid not watch expecting entertained but instead resort drinking settle down watching stressful convoluted mess nothingness what even point traditional dinner still nonstop annoying loudness useless chatter i get writers novicenewbs but least have seasoned writer proofread mess before goes action viewers watch stunned 135 mins wondering what theyre watching only get stupid ending 410 all going sandlers great performance,6
Uncut Gems,wtf why high ratings its 135 min pure noise,1
Uncut Gems,sandler good actor pulls off noncomedy role but what sad depressing film yeah yeah certain reviewers will give positive reviews because realism depth i call bs why watch movie about train wreck main character continues denigrate throughout movie there enough true life problems world dont want spend my entertainment time not being entertained,1
Uncut Gems,if you down want depressed movie you,1
Uncut Gems,film essentially 2 hours people shouting swearing each other sandler plays role surprisingly well but characters difficult like storyline starts off difficult follow then fades into nothing ending lazy just not good film,1
Trolls World Tour,watched high weird movie probably only way watch,7
Trolls World Tour,ok my kids ages 4 7 lost focus many times while watching music pretty good but nowhere near good first trolls movie,6
Trolls World Tour,all thats happening world right now movie perfect i liked first trolls movie but i loveeeee one i love animation movies general but franchise definitely some my favorites i think i may bit biased because i love both anna kendrick jt their friendship offscreen too but one thing i didnt like fact annas vocals still not featured soundtrack even though she lead character,9
Trolls World Tour,movie cannot decide if wants support individuality group mentality early there lesson about people being people no matter who what they then halfway through explains dangers homogeneity end tried teach old separate but equal thinking i know its movie made children but there no clear message my 8 year old daughter asked me what moral movie i didnt know what tell her,5
Trolls World Tour,what earth i watched first trolls my son taken aback quality story music they had first one arrangement sound silence so surprisingly good made me misty eyed music sequel beyond subpar continuity confusing has nothing do first movie point im literally lost how first one could have happened troll universe honestly i am not surprised how dumbed down movie also movie says different music each land yeah its all pop dont waste your time,1
Trolls World Tour,initially i thought film would just cute characters singing pop songs all time fact there plot which touches heartstrings too colour scheme kaleidoscopic music infectiously catchy one big party but also has message adults think about i enjoyed way more than i thought i would,6
Trolls World Tour,i had watched first trolls enjoyed story friendship music i went into second movie high hopes expectations i understand message they were attempting portray movie all children but doing so took some fun out movie kudos message they were attempting send all children adults but doing so took some fun out movie overall somewhat slow but still fun watch whether your children get message not they will still enjoy movie,1
Trolls World Tour,film just colourful incoherent mess,1
Trolls World Tour,we were big fans first film our house have watched numerous times so when we heard there going sequel we knew wed heading cinema alas not so when announced film would avaliable rent via streaming we decided rent easter sunday im thankful i didnt have trek cinema watch but annoyed i paid over £16 watch comfort my own house,10
Trolls World Tour,first film had character charm catchy songs decent story conveyed important message film has none above storyboard consisted nothing more than someone throwing obscene amount glitter then craming many songs possible into none songs were get back up again standout,7
Trolls World Tour,clearly scriptwriters couldnt agree whether poppy right all along wrong all along both confirmed true they then decided tack music comes within message end afterthought copying happiness comes within one first film,1
Trolls World Tour,obviously i dont expect oscar worthy movie trolls film theres always element copy pasting formula first film sequels but film just missed beat everytime example they reused character pooping confectionary first film but completely omit bergen which criminal,4
Trolls World Tour,if i could give minus score i would,2
Trolls World Tour,i so excited watch one my kids first movie had pretty good plot likeable characters some good songs all combined premise different genre music trolls sounded pretty cool,3
Trolls World Tour,but plot convoluted moves breakneck speed queen barb annoying music just one long mashup no actual songs,7
Trolls World Tour,also when i think female singer introduce country trolls i think reba dolly parton nope they used kelly clarkson all genres pop doing imitation,2
Trolls World Tour,fun feel good film family my 6 year old daughter absolutely loved just what we needed little escape we were planning go movies watch,5
Trolls World Tour,i still enjoyed trolls 1 bit more packed bit stronger emotional punch,4
Trolls World Tour,either way im happy i watched trolls 2 definitely isnt weak sequel,9
Trolls World Tour,really bad first trolls movie fantastic just pointless horrible no storyline just desperate attempt put 50 songs into one movie my kids lost interest immediately really bummed,3
Trolls World Tour,loved first trolls but wow what underwhelming cracked out ride were they opioids when they made movie because some parts so random story lacking actual story where bergens also hate when actors get changed out some voices not samethis movie lacks focus lacks good songs good storyline very disappointed,1
Trolls World Tour,first truly excellent,10
Trolls World Tour,seems rushed quick we need film quick we need theme,1
Trolls World Tour,not very original all bits put together not real foot thumping tunes,1
It Chapter Two,its been while since ive read book seen first movie so i apologize if i get some things wrong,6
It Chapter Two,tldr film drags middle splitting up crew subjecting them meaningless jump scares means little character interaction which part what first movie had going time you get final confrontation pennywise youre just tired jump scares want over because youre not really rooting losers if you its mostly because what established first film,5
It Chapter Two,pros,2
It Chapter Two,cons,5
It Chapter Two,i really realllly wanted like film huge fan original miniseries everything tim curry i knew id have challenge going into both chapter 1 chapter 2 open mind i had separate i didnt have high expectations i did chapter 1 part 2 mini series much weaker than part 1 anyway well stephen kings book,4
It Chapter Two,actors were great even first few jump scares were decent then just became overkill not scary whatsoever all cgi monsters look ridiculous completely take you out moment i grew up watching 80s90s horror loving baddies were real terrifying example mrs massey bloated bathtub corpse shining real completely horrifying image has stayed me 30 years after i first saw movie i dont understand obsession cgi when theres no need,3
It Chapter Two,sadly movie just drawn out bore,1
It Chapter Two,why they tried add so much humor beyond me ruined entire movie,1
It Chapter Two,now guy plays pennywise did great job except cgi pennywise out his handswhen he played character no cgi i blown away,5
It Chapter Two,im big baby when comes scary movies even i can say i wasnt scared jump scares were alright but cgi monsters just made movie feel immature alsopennywise flesh eating clown hypnotic powersand they bullied him death defeat him just such corny scene watching pennywise shrink they say mean things him lmao,6
It Chapter Two,only god knows how i wanted love film,3
It Chapter Two,big fan masterpiece book i eager part ii i liked first part i didnt love but good adaption,5
It Chapter Two,other hand second part slow i didnt feel chemistry between adult version losers club dont get me wrong acting good but somethings off,2
It Chapter Two,i didnt get insinuations about ritchies sexual orientation why wasnt book either way they chose kill pennywise shameful ultrasimple solution made me feel dumb sigh,2
It Chapter Two,oh last but not least cgi fest i really dont like cgi horror flicks i dont think impossible use not all but god what cgi monster fest i think muschietti has great future director but theres lot learn,3
It Chapter Two,part ii let down sadly,5
It Chapter Two,agh woah agh woah agh woah agh woah beginning 3040 mins decent setup well shot dinner scene somewhat funny then all goes down hill there,3
It Chapter Two,firstly those people giving 9 10what did they put your popcorn did you see different movie should you allowed leave reviews if your taste movies bad some poor sod might read your review go see moviedo you not feel any guilt,3
It Chapter Two,awful its not even worth constructing proper sentences so ill leave these points here,1
It Chapter Two,1 terrible acting awful actors were either bored overacting bill mike richie seriously terrible,5
It Chapter Two,2 what earth need make 3 hour movie so unnecessarily dragged out incredibly boring,1
It Chapter Two,3 story had no story mike tells them theres indian ritual they must collect artefacts which separates them all 2 hours movie but then turns out there no ritualwhat what point ben threw into fire something hed held dear his wallet 27 years fornoreason,3
It Chapter Two,4 seperating characters like filling scenes flashbacks made sure there no character development,5
It Chapter Two,5 erm what happened bills wife bev kissing all guys but still married they turned bevs character into gold digging floozy having her kiss bill then choose wealthy better looking ben his boat,8
It Chapter Two,6 what name all mike myers terrible cgi about old granny scene original scary she creepy old lady not 15 foot naked zombie like monster,5
The Hunt,movie equal opportunity offender its hilarious pokes fun everyone says dont worry you can laugh even if its your own expense,9
The Hunt,i think controversy around makes even funnier because i didnt find anything offended about movie because its satire its saying things wink making fun characters saying these things i think anyway,8
The Hunt,betty gilpin great she really knew what movie she,9
The Hunt,also has way keeping you your toes especially start kind refreshing,8
The Hunt,took me while watch based reviews all political nonsense but i am so happy i changed my mind one most entertaining movies ive seen last year while there political undertones references theyre not over played adds entertainment i highly recommend movie its good some laughs isnt light action,9
The Hunt,i went thinking id hate movie but turned out loving lead character well written betty gilpin pulls her off amazingly never saw actress anything before but will try find her other movies,10
The Hunt,much more enjoyable than expected,8
The Hunt,beginning funny enough but ensuing few scenes which riotously hilarious make worth watching i literally laughed until i cried,9
The Hunt,toward middle film there wide gap where laughoutloud moments slowed further further apart but still bring smile giggle here there ending while good overshadowed preceding fight scene one books really really well done,10
The Hunt,best part entire movie though what makes stand out if person watching has more than two brain cells dialogue spoton closetoperfect mocking both sides political divide here what i think people missing neither side depicted being better than other worse has fun expense everyone doesnt do any overtly mean way but way where we can nod nod nod laugh ourselves no matter who we where we stand,9
The Hunt,lastly horror film not somewhat gory yes horror film no,10
The Hunt,7610,7
The Hunt,major spoilers alert,8
The Hunt,film great escapist fun also satirizes our bizarrely extreme cultural divide refreshing able bring gonzo humor over top gore way step back mindless anger group think top betty gilpins brilliantly played crystal creasy something unique film while ostensibly written familiar mary sue able kick any ass beat down any threat crystal sardonic participant mad mad world highly intelligent yet without affectations she really does not give damn why everyone trying kill her she also one character movie who does not comfortably fit into extreme left right stereotypes spite all superficial appearances contrary,6
The Hunt,i also credit writers nick cuse damon lindelof being willing subversively skewer their own their sharpest barbs reserved their fellow elites while deplorables mostly just one dimensional cartoonish characters rarely provided more depth than aptly hilariously named yoga pants shut up gary,10
The Hunt,other hand elite hunters characters fleshed out many little details conceits familiar those who travel similar circles athena babbles tritely unoriginally about singular importance cutting tomatoes bread knife using gruyere her grilled cheese sandwich speech which takes place mansion she keeps insisting not manor she her compatriots toss off animal farm snowball references sort intellectual adornment insult shibboleth while revealing they understand next nothing about book they were probably once forced read some boring english class,10
The Hunt,films conflict originates one elite characters being found out sleeping his wifes oncologist which leads his dismissal his charitable foundation another talks about his dubious devotion peasant lover he has inconveniently knocked up they all look down hired hand sargent dale who only allowed smallest modicum respect having small part bruce willis movie tears sun why sun crying even choice having action set croatia something inside joke has recently been preferred destination fashionable set seeking avoid common company hoi polloi,9
The Hunt,movie starts turtle ends hare mirroring awesomely twisted violent bedtime story crystal says her mother used tell her story serves sort explanation her uniquely detached outlook her singular ability spot deadly threats based smallest tells,9
The Hunt,films conclusion crystal echos story arc napoleon animal farm character she transforms her deplorable self donning athenas signature red bottomed stiletto pumps slipping into her stylish black dress commandeering her plane while tossing back athenas prized champagne caviar,10
The Hunt,why its cinderella story,7
The Hunt,highly recommended if you have sense humor can enjoy stupid fun movie,10
The Hunt,movie starts great twelve strangers kidnapped then hunted group rich people simple plot normal acting fast paced unpredictable funny fun all first exciting 15 mins,10
The Hunt,then all sudden nearly middle movie slows downgets redundant annoying very predictable over used dull yet unrealistic hero character type type knows all never fails will accomplish anything beside fact falsely classified horror has nothing do genre dramatic plot ridiculously idiotic reason why behind film completely unbelievable unrealistic fighting scenes were lame they lack any logic credibility due hero never fails concept not mention extremely stupid predictable ending which spotted mile ahead,8
Vivarium,got half decent idea short tv episode but hey leave out cuckoo opening scenes then no need spell out whole thing beforehand but feature its just amateurish mess without much thought balance its storytelling coherence behind yes surreal but doesnt make any better,5
Vivarium,there many artworkss i have come across i dont understand grate my eyes ears but i could never say worst ive ever come across i want my money time back i just acknowledge i dont understand move rhetoric used many reviews here other titles here nothing short churlish immature i hope people more rational minds can ignore cancel culture reviews use better judgement whether film worth their time money give equally fair reviews,7
Vivarium,being said ive given 7 good but not great my personal estimation your mileage may vary recommend highly lovers noir fantasyscience fiction parables bleak social commentary framed carrolliankafkaesquedavid lynch setup many others like me may probably like enjoy appreciate varying degrees but shouldnt hate,1
Vivarium,two leads eisenberg poots quite up demands their predicament puts them show varied range emotions states supporting child actor however gives me willies if wasnt his normal voice i hearing his mannerisms posture acting were still scarily onpoint if his voice however his career should skyrocket family their dynamic both exaggerated mirror modern unprepared families well starkly portrayed descent into madness,6
Vivarium,set design overall production quality obviously lowbudget but very effective nonetheless perfectly evokes subliminal nausea modern suburbia often instills you asked pay more attention tasteless food cookie cutter clouds pictures walls better understand complete lack emotion creativity antagonists how completely different species they,2
Vivarium,script only thing i knock point off while didnt do anything wrong per se i can agree some reviewers maybe just maybe some kind clarification exposition slightly less bleak ending would make more palatable much wider audience but then we would remiss if we asked picasso paint whole face jackson pollock join some dots up give us clue sadly therefore point lost my own others lack vision understanding not writerdirectors ability,7
Vivarium,full waste time although i have lot free time due lock down still time could have been used something else,3
Vivarium,way movie played out ended felt very similar black mirror episode felt like its missing something there lot great things movie performance cinematography color scheme but doesnt make up one thing lacks excitement honestly watching movie made me feel like i ate big meal im full but wasnt what i craving overall bland i have feeling point movie make you feel like nothing make you feel melancholy andor depressed really makes you question your existence your place earth if perfection really what we crave if life really matters so did achieve its goal however probably could have been slightly more entertaining but then maybe wouldnt have been effective its tough grey area i probably wouldnt watch again recommend someone whos depressed if you like unique artsy surreal films give go but dont expect too much excuse my horrible grammar spelling,9
Vivarium,i honestly cannot believe we watched entire movie but we really wondered how got decent reviews so we stuck all i can say writer director eisenherg had all their friends acquaintances sign up give 10 stars,7
Vivarium,movie never goes anywhere has no purpose characters have no purpose accomplish nothing besides digging hole so nothing lol i would rather watch season finale lost once week rest year than watch again,7
Vivarium,sooo bad i showed my kid highlights took less than 5 minutes,4
Vivarium,i gave 2 stars just because bad enough where i inspired sign up write review,1
Vivarium,ive been quarantine since midmarch now mid july ive literally havent left my house during entire time not run errands not walk around block i havent been outside,3
Vivarium,maybe i should say i havent been outside perimeter my house i have been my backyard good weather days,8
Vivarium,so my life consists my husband going out getting food doing most cooking serving me breakfast dinner sometimes lunch because he likes keep busy ive become slug,7
Vivarium,i go bed i get up i do work then i stop working watch some tv go bed get up do all over again ive been doing day after day 100 20 days,9
Vivarium,i can relate i think its obvious whats going there were lot breadcrumbs thrown around along way,1
Vivarium,obviously these aliens they studying our species learn how imitate us notice thats what kid doing his voice combination both parents eventually take over world,8
Vivarium,apparently they patient species looks me like world they created had several levels there were families each level,7
Vivarium,i guess soon enough theyll push us out our nest much like cuckoo bird replace us,1
Vivarium,end,9
Vivarium,i take back course vivarium ingenious commentary about either its completely innocuous science fictionfantasy story without any meaning anyone demanding meaning clearly just snob nice thing about hollow movies like critics can have both ways some kind brilliant profound statement about some kind prescient social issueand if you complain about being pretentious you just dont know how have fun,10
Vivarium,much some ideas were interesting here movie dull slog filled overacting not convincing special effects constant waffling vague philosophy mostly just bored grouchy looking people dimly lit rooms staring into space,10
Vivarium,only real attention paid making film look pretty does times but over stylization takes away any potential feeling real peril,1
Vivarium,if supposed profound dont make so silly if supposed entertaining dont make so plodding selfimpressed,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,i saw movie december 4 indonesian premiere,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,whole story good follow up welcome jungle jumanji2 film some added actors danny devito danny glover good choice,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,while i confused beginning who who once they were back game script itself allowed avators exchanged so they went back welcome jungle avators people who were those i hope you understand what i mean,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,story simply new adventure so much different previous instalment not boring all while rated pg13 i found general very good family movie,7
Jumanji: The Next Level,all all all honesty i already look forward jumanji 4 xmas 2020 xmas 2021 would do just fine,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,thumbs up movie 810,7
Jumanji: The Next Level,before going cinema see «the next level» jumanji i rewatched first movie just refresh my memory after watching new one i must say wasnt underwhelming all,6
Jumanji: The Next Level,addition what first film brought new «jumanji» has,7
Jumanji: The Next Level,given above its time wrap up «jumanji next level» solid following 2017s movie its all about laughter fun amusement adventures course case if you seen «jumanji welcome jungle» enjoyed new «next level» wont let you down,6
Jumanji: The Next Level,mild mild spoilers ahead,7
Jumanji: The Next Level,i scared theyd somehow screw up sequel reboot they did but i greatly surprise new elements they added grandpas subplot way executed their contribution jumanji gaming experience they were both hilarious all new additions felt exactly how sequel 90s sequel game would feel like new abilities weapons scenery wouldbe levels game they still felt like theyd actually levels game its exactly what i hoped theyd add because thats kind thing first movie did tried work stereotypes elements found those good old adventure games like tomb raider,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,i also liked they brought back whole gang reason why movies like where most logical thing would make anthologic different kids experiencing game so when they try use same characters supposedly learned something their past experience recipe disaster because its hard bring all gang together without being forced but i liked way they did felt controlled fulfilling end,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,conclusion funny entertaining creative action adventure movie its not gonna win any oscars but its so wrll thought its delight watch i feel never grows old you can rewatch enjoy all over again,6
Jumanji: The Next Level,even though its central concept seems eversoslightly more strained time jumanji next level 2019 about good its predecessor fact its sometimes even better basically flick just fun crowdpleasing bodyswapping amped up eleven shaking things up just enough so they feel fresh main actors continue properly impress their chameleonlike roles joined few extra treats perform far better than youd perhaps expect indeed these new players probably its biggest asset couple them thoroughly perforate entire experience despite only having rather small amount screentime picture often funny though never hilarious oddly endearing boot isnt particularly deep even memorable but doesnt need its good time movies what more do you need obviously some better theming perhaps tad nuance wouldnt go amiss but its just not kind film really thats perfectly fine even if doesnt impact you much some years best itll certainly make you smile keep you entertained couple hours besides its inciting incident driven purely character even manages squeeze some genuine emotional connection via welldrawn dynamic between devito glover into its otherwise otherworldly proceedings its acting also deceptively simple but decidedly fantastic fully immersing you idea these major stars actually four teenagers two old men basically its not simple you might think 710,7
Jumanji: The Next Level,honest i dont have high expectation sequel but turns out exceeded all my expectations,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,jumanji next level added new character skills jokes all us i could hear audiences cinema laugh jokes enjoy much my boyfriend i enjoyed yeah i have admit there were some repeated patterns first one but along way they also added several stuffs which brought fresh air whole movie,5
Jumanji: The Next Level,also i think sequel conveyed deeper messages than first one potrayed characters problem which we can related our real life lesson i got sequel sometimes you will hit end but doesnt mean over means all you have do living present look different perspectives,5
Jumanji: The Next Level,plot story kinds light predictable but hey decent sequel you can enjoy your family side notes they had after credits scene might hints about potential third movie jumanji,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,i thought last jumanji movie pretty decent not perfect but definitely not bad if you liked one you will like very much just more same if aint broke you know,6
Jumanji: The Next Level,couple new faces one them i really liked seeing wont say who but if youre older than 20 chances good you like person,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,action like last time its entertaining but not mind blowing effects overall good rock has some lets call them punching scenes which i liked although action direction overall could have been slightly better tighter,6
Jumanji: The Next Level,they once again have fun fact characters game represent characters movies real life i am pretty impressed how actors fared maybe especially dwayne johnson i think hes taking some serious acting classes hes getting better overall cast very likeable,10
Jumanji: The Next Level,i didnt feel quite much i video game time around though felt more like just adventure than adventure videogame they could have hammered home little better so yeah i entertained but its pretty shallow wont stick me like say origianl jumanji i watched kid kind revolutionary so course stuck nice family flick,8
Jumanji: The Next Level,fun time cast performances both very good here its fun popcorn movie although there some shocks somewhat violent deaths throughout which i found jarring strange tone choice however great bunch likable comedy actorsyoung actors being given freedom have fun these roles there also some exciting setpieces creative vfx wise choice bring back entire cast too some new additions id recommend movie anyone wants see fun actionpacked video gameblockbuster likable entertaining actors but beware jump scares scary animals if youre sensitive sort thing,9
Jumanji: The Next Level,i absolutely loved first instalment large extent those enjoyed first will enjoy its still entertaining fast paced humerous only thing i found rather than laughing out loud being edge my seat like first i had occasional chuckle sat back having said laughing out loud not i never bored still had smile my face majority film decent sequel exiting interesting point potential 3rd movie,10
The King of Staten Island,i have followed judd petes careers pretty closely so naturally i exited see movie i wanted see theaters but renting 20 dollars my living room my only option now,8
The King of Staten Island,pete has proved himself funny guy competent actor even though hes playing similar character his role big time adolescence big step forward his career,8
The King of Staten Island,i think movie will probably receive criticism not being funny some judd appatows other movies but i dont think movie aiming same thing superbad 40 year old virgin judd often talks about how key making good comedy make good drama add humor perfect example,8
The King of Staten Island,petes story intriguing feels completely worthy movie like some people wanting non stop laugh fest maybe not like does have flaws but i really enjoyed,8
The King of Staten Island,probably judds best movie 10 years i highly recommend giving watch,7
The King of Staten Island,film true gem i went into not expecting much but i disappointed when movie over not many films ive seen recently left me feeling way especially davidsons previous film big time adolescence king staten island funny heartfelt raw times personally ive always felt like pete davidson least funny member snl but film opened my eyes what he about person where his comedy stemmed i appreciate film doesnt pretend something different than what petes semibiographical story brought life comedy directingproducing pro judd apatow supporting cast marisa tomei bill burr steve buscemi bring some pretty great performances table well great story about weird part life your early twenties where youre still not really sure what youre doing where youre going lifes journey deals living through loss growing up finding out your purpose world i will recommend friends,10
The King of Staten Island,film unapologetically introspective raw feels amateurish times but overall really works story being told more drama than comedy but some truly funny moments,9
The King of Staten Island,great addition judd apatows comedy sentimental work happy see pete davidson succeed role really happy movie,10
The King of Staten Island,fine day something funny relatable wholesome king staten island delivers rather enjoyable package department judd apatows most famous include 40yearold virgin which i loved knocked up last before last whole 5 years ago trainwreck which i happened catch big screen okay but not fan time around apatow directs story cowritten its standout star pete davidson dedicated his dad scott davidson quite heavily inspired petes own life though not without its flaws i can tell you king staten island easily my favorite judd apatow piece since 2005,9
The King of Staten Island,most probably known member snl now rising comic actor cool dude pete davidson portraying scott 24 year old who has been case add ever since his firefighter dad died when he seven jobless living mom scott spends his days smoking bud hanging out friends dreaming being tattoo artist when some new characters enter his life he forced grapple grief trauma take his first steps towards redemption real life pete davidsons father firefighter who died line duty rescuing victims 911 attack cast member steve buscemi used firefighter wake 80s returned help day same tragedy,8
The King of Staten Island,king staten island mainly story about growing up finding good things learning accept those good things taking responsibility over ones life theres genuine sentiment its heart which rests just right place can also legitimately funny its not structurally perfect can feel little too scenic focusing quality separate sequences do not add lot story big turning point starts manifesting itself late 100 minutes into movie end 2 hour 17 minute runtime little too tall having said dramedy thats never boring always pleasantly amusing kind plot i believe pretty predictable default so enjoy substitute alwayspresentlowkeycharm 23 year currently stuck my hometown great friends mary jane i felt like appropriate audience member king staten island thats what i meant relatable wholesome some might say big part movie isnt about whole lot anything but i beg differ perhaps idyllic view such simplicities tells lot,5
The King of Staten Island,i think its apparent pete davidson pivotal part why movie works so well what might very likely his best performance date he plays likeable decent guy good heart some troubles plays him so authentically one could guess some comes place past pain but thats not supporting cast delivers well above average performances well do not miss chance see bill burr bigger role rocking impressive moustache female counterparts both bel powley marisa tomei anchor balance perfectly,5
The King of Staten Island,judd apatow arguably one hollywood heavyweights making film cast dont fall back all much so level these ingredients resemble themselves also every technical aesthetical department its visually very well orchestrated subtle perfect its simplicity never once anything distracting catches eye soundtrack has couple real nice tunes which one deartomyheart nostalgia song ended film but i wont spoil,10
The King of Staten Island,even now i wonder why not more because i really really dug but i believe deserves good flavorful perhaps even memorable 710 i recommend well just about everyone whos not too young even one point intrigue enough,9
The King of Staten Island,bill burr pete davidson amazing duo i know not type movie where they would have part 2 but i would throughly enjoying watching story continue all these characters little long but you would really feel emotion between bill pete,2
The King of Staten Island,king staten island deeper dive into pete davidson mostly autobiographical look why he way he well done well written great supporting cast bill burr marissa tomei steve buscemi all were steller supporting roles,2
The King of Staten Island,prepared dark not funny haha but definitely uses humor deflect uncomfortable situations petes always been intriguing character me so great way pull layers back its not always pretty but i think definitely worth price,2
The King of Staten Island,i excited about movie simply because its apatow product im somewhat new fan davidson i cried through first viewing laughed more but still cried through second viewing my 48hr rental well done thank you sharing your story such cerebral human way i will purchase soon its available purchase,5
The King of Staten Island,films intention take you journey presents itself initially simple character study divulges though you begin see its actually examination people interact lead how they effect effected his actions,1
The King of Staten Island,quick cuts edits perfect representation ebb flow real life no way unintentional mistake,7
The King of Staten Island,premise subject matter not easily digested but core story young man stricken grief who wants contribute find where he belongs,2
The King of Staten Island,funny heartwarming original will leave you satisfied after viewing,5
The King of Staten Island,ill honesti liked movie way more than i expected i possibly could pete davidson great film wellwritten funny touching highly recommended weekend viewing,4
The King of Staten Island,three big problems 1 pete davidsons acting very distracting everyone else great but his reactions didnt match their actions 2 petes character way too much selfpity cliche meh im broken please feel bad me 3 forgettable nothing deep special very interesting happens theres not enough funny make up,7
The Shining,when film first came out 1980 i remember going see opening night sheer terror i experienced viewing shining enough make me go bed lights turned every night entire summer movie just scared life out me which what still happens every time i rent video rewatch i have seen shining least six seven times i still believe simultaneously paradoxically one most frightening yet funniest films ive ever seen frightening because extraordinarily effective use long shots create feelings isolation convex lens shots enhance surrealism meticulously scored music bring tension levels virtually unbearable levels funny because jack nicholsons outrageous many cases adlibbed onscreen antics never ceases amaze me how shining actually two films one both comedy horror flick ghostly apparitions strikingly menacing nature haunt much first half film which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats time progresses may there surprisingly little violence given apparent intensity but little comfort feint heart much terror more implied than manifest shining truly frightening movie works symbolically many levels but basically about human shortcomings way they can exploited unconscious forces combined weakness will film scares most just using suggestion turn your own imagination against you shining brilliant cinematic masterpiece likes which have never been seen before since highly highly recommended paul,9
The Shining,i cant praise film long enough,9
The Shining,shining without doubt one stanley kubricks undisputed masterpieces true classic horror cinema film over course years has managed scare living hell out its audiences still does film adaptation stepehen kings original novel written late 70s although film not very loyal book still stands thing its own,10
The Shining,right beginning we contemplate car going hotel those stunning aerial shots deeply inside us we know something film somehow sometime going go wrong we obtain severe warning almost inaudible voice gently whispers us sit tight sense unexpectedness invades us all very same feeling makes our hair stand end throughout out entire movie,5
The Shining,plot simple jack torrance jack nicholson becomes caretaker overlook hotel up secluded mountains colorado jack being family man takes his wife shelley duvall son danny lloyd hotel keep him company throughout long isolated nights during their stay strange things occur when jacks son danny sees gruesome images powered force called shining jack heavily affected along writers block demons hotel haunting him jack has complete mental breakdown situation takes sinister turn worse,10
The Shining,film unlike many horrororiented films nowadays doesnt only rely stomachchurning gory images which does contain anyway but incredibly scary music based works béla bartók excellent cinematography steadicam superbly used giving us sense everfollowing evil well terrifying mood atmosphere film carefully masterfully woven kubrick who clearly knows how really make horror movie,4
The Shining,jack nicholsons powerful performance mad father husband over top brilliant shelley duvall who plays worrying wife who tries help her son also stand out she shows kind trembling fear many scenes able display weakness vulnerability very convincing way undoubtedly shining full memorable moments elevator scene heeeeeeres johnny oneliner instance simply put its flawlessly brilliant,8
The Shining,stanley kubricks direction pure excellence giving whole film cold atmospheric look thus creating unbearable sense paranoia terror there moments sheer brilliance exquisite perfection film horrifying maze chase perfect example every single shot masterfully created there some genuinely scary scenes which will make you sit edge your seat,1
The Shining,shining my opinion special landmark horror cinema which will always regarded one scariest movies film history since i saw last year when i 13 i have rarely been able have bath my bathtubjust case ya know overall shining incomparably scariest film ive ever seen my whole life i can tell you ive seen great deal horror films,9
The Shining,unforgettable chilling majestic truly profoundly scary film crafted eccentric genius who wants show impossible can done shining sublime hauntingly intriguing endlessly watchable film shows kubrick his best,1
The Shining,stephen king may have said master director knew nothing about horror but simply not true too biased opinion anyone go given he wrote book which kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely any rate faithful not kubricks shiningthe best crafted genre film 80s performs its duty fright flick then some,10
The Shining,there appropriately no words strong enough convey haunting beauty visuals showcased throughout movie drive overlook final chase hedgemaze movie feast eyes mind feast mind shining psychological horror gets toying relentlessly expertly your emotions expectationssome could even say sadistically throwing something thats completely out left field never ever letting you catch your breath between now classic shocks movie speeds toward its memorable conclusion last half hour,1
The Shining,kudos order kubrick director old school style who builds eerie atmosphere exercising total control over filmic environment manipulating everything down tiniest detail suit needs picture yet filming coldly detatched objective eye though kubrick were making documentary about these events would account dialouge whichthankfullyis not typical phoney balloney hollywood banter kubrick detractorsking purists usually bitch about most having been weaned phony nature hollywood talk which usually nothing all like real talk many us speak nose do not try convey subtext through use carefully chosen words articulate our state being without being direct light shelley duvall must commended her performance which very naturalistic does not seem like acting all she not concerned glamour nor does she clutter her performance typical acting chops but rather she solely focussed hitting emotional highpoints her character wendy gradually comes realize her husband madman lets face folks how many us would like million bucks when placed situation like who does not look like blubbering idiot when they hysterical thats what i thought so what did you expect she great say nothing rest cast,5
The Shining,even though shining over quarter century old i challenge anyone not get freaked out jack nicholsons descent into madness rare example something so unique no one has been able rip off instead has been referenced time again pop culture twins elevator blood redrum crazy nonsense writing should seen if nothing else understand all allusions daily life film simultaneously scary suspenseful beautiful psychologically intriguing has classic mystery hitchcock terror modern thriller has what horror movies usually lack great script,10
The Shining,chilling majestic piece cinematic fright film combines all great elements intellectual thriller grand vision director who has instinctual capacity pace moody horror flick within realm his filmmaking genius includes eye original shot icecold soundtrack overall sense dehumanization movie cuts through all typical horror movies like redpoker through human eye allows viewer not only feel violence psychosis its protagonist but appreciate seed which derangement stems one scariest things people face unknown film presents its plotting just thought mind setting perfect desolate winter hideaway quietness moment character itself fermenting aggressor jack torrances mind wallows idle time breeds devils new playground i always felt like presence evil dormant all our minds only circumstances moment reasons given therein needed wake its violent ass pounce over its unsuspecting victims film perfect example very thought,1
The Shining,within films subtle touches canvas clackityclacks young boys big wheel riding along empty hallways hotel labyrinthian garden representing minds fine line between sane insane kubricks purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies continuity errors set misarrangements we discover world guided righteous tangible but coaxed away powerful unknown i have never read book upon which film based but without comparison point i am proud say one most terrifying films i have ever seen i thought runtime film couldve been cut little bit but then again i am not one most acclaimed directors history film so maybe i should keep my twocent criticisms over superb film myself all all movie captures your attention its grand form vision ropes you some terror eccentric direction ties you down stabs you heart its coldeyed view mans mind gone overboard creepy atmosphere loss humanity,1
The Shining,rating 910,7
Scoob!,first 15 mins great why they couldnt have just kept origin story how gang met started solving mysteries beyond me instead story spirals off into million directions filled tons poorly executed pop culture references animation stellar but plot diminishes one lot im not expecting just like tv series but my kids got more excited beginning movie started lose interest went sometimes i wonder if these screenwriters working kids movies actually have kids so disappointing big missed opportunity,5
Scoob!,i never really biggest fan scooby doo i watched some epispodes but i never really gravitated show characters but even watching so little episodes you can tell very different cartoon doesnt feel like scooby doo there arent any mysteries haunted houses superhero movie wth scooby doo characters,4
Scoob!,villian actually pretty good he has clear motivation you understand whats he doing why hes doing he can also funny which perfect kids movie like,6
Scoob!,voice actors did good job standouts me mark whalberg jason isaacs frank welker,1
Scoob!,movie really funny lot jokes land well especially character fred whenever hes screen he gives funny vibe you cant help but laugh whenever he tells joke,2
Scoob!,biggest problem me just generic kids movie follows same formula all kids movies setup relationship two characters seperate them make them reconcile earn power friendship save day top add bunch pop songs movie afraid take risks shake things up because doesnt add anything new genre doesnt add anything new scooby doo characters its just forgetable if im mood scooby doo i wont watch i will watch original cartoon if im mood 21st century kids movie i wont watch i will just go watch lego movie my point movie doesnt stand out any way,5
Scoob!,i conslusion i dont think generic kids movie worth 20 dollars,1
Scoob!,410 you can skip youre not missing much,3
Scoob!,doesnt matter what age we when comes scooby doo always will must watch now if youre following scoobydoo animated cartoons series movies then you already know how cross overs common scoob no different youll see other characters hannabarbera such bluefalcon his dog dick dastardly wacky racers main antagonist alongside muttley cameo providing you total nostalgic journey especially if your 90s kids older film follows how scoob gang met when they were childrens following scoobydoo theme song scooby dooby doo where you we got some work do now same picturization weve seen 90s movie seted modern times where youll find ikea netflixs jokes along insta selfies major weak point about movie mystery part when comes scooby doo there has ghost ending iconic removal face mask following those meddling kids but sadly you wont see time thats sad very very sad,1
Scoob!,i realize scoob basically kids cartoon generic movie i realize i am long past target audiences age however i grew up fan original scooby doo cartoon i 4 yearsold when cartoon originally aired i have fond memories those saturday mornings people responsible making these new movies have taken most what made show good thrown out window ghosts monsters werent real there always rational explanation behind everything went part fun trying wrap my 4 yearold brain around how bad guys were doing their evil deeds but movie based anything approaching reality wouldnt work big overbloated cgi mess like scoob its unreal its loud leaves nothing imagination film consistently makes fun itself imsmarterthanyou selfreferential way i find so annoying its shame me young kids today will not growup understanding charm original scooby doo,5
Scoob!,my boyfriend i waited months he loves scooby doo he bought his niece scooby doo christmas promote his propaganda scooby doo he woke up today 15th may his first words saying its scoob day we brought snacks middle pandemic brought them home we watched i saw light his eyes leave when simon cowell introduced when blue falcon dabbed made cringey jokes etc hes ruined man velma does not sound like velma all shared universe youve destroyed man first 15 minutes were good though hence extra star lol,1
Scoob!,did not have classic scooby vibe trying hard hip mystery incorporated cartoon so much better,2
Scoob!,those hoping watch fun origin story scooby doo maybe fun giant epic mystery adventure film unfortunately film misses mark what you should expect see another average cgi animated cliche extremely bland predictable super hero film film tried accomplish too much during its runtime ends up accomplishing nothing,1
Scoob!,movie dies after first 15 minutes starts its super cute actually resembles scoobydoo but then just goes off rails has stupid cameos pop culture nonsense like dabbing so basic plot just nonsense boring,4
Scoob!,i dont love animation style they look like they made each plastic voice acting kinda off putting because most part non characters sound like any incarnation them past which strange some old cast members spoke about wanting return were disappointed not asked,1
Scoob!,my other complaint there want really main monster fight against seemed randomly pop up end just didnt seem like scoobydoo,1
Scoob!,movie horrible took scooby doo turned emoji movie has references older fans but takes charm scooby doo turns into bad childrens movie why have todays kids grow up scooby doo being way truely disappointed keep fans older scooby doo keep us out dont put references originals something isnt scooby doo all its basically whole different movie scooby gang pasted into thats just appearances new personalitys shouldve made movie original animated scooby doo movies mind would been great,2
Scoob!,i can see what they were going crossing over other hannabarbera characters but doing so i think they stripped away lot what makes scoobydoo so great i always drawn mystery incs skepticism all things supernatural child i felt i could dip my toe into something spooky but humour adventure would balance all out even film snippets gangs spooky hijinks were highlight me without i feel there no scoobydoo saying animation beautiful i do love these characters i think zac efron perfect casting choice fred i feel thankful has gone straight streaming rather than wide theatrical release i can only hope new generation finds better entry point into scoobydoo rather than film,2
Scoob!,i really wanted like movie i truly did but not scoobydoo movie first all please tell me why do they insist having real monsters when whole point scoobydoo disproving supernatural orgin story origin scoobydoo having fake monsters they completely ruin aspect movie have some type underworld concept 3 skulls opening portals underworld what earth not scoobydoo i grew up im so angry myself buying movie such waste my money top its more blue falcon movie rather than scoobydoo one has zero mystery comedy forced will age badly few years,6
Scoob!,only good quality movie has great animation other than i hated i will contacting apple getting my money back,6
Scoob!,im huge scooby fan i immensely disappointed,2
Scoob!,another cgi product chucks out all charm original favour contemporary postmodern gibberish selfreferential jokes do nothing but make all characters smug unlikeable i wish cartoon i wish had spooky mystery its heart i wish scooby doo,6
Scoob!,we have come love cast last decade why take heart out movie will forte doesnt do shaggy justice suspension disbelief gone cast mystery inc i want my money back,1
Scoob!,i loved scoobydoo cartoons child so i expected similar impressions feelings animated film there were also hopes franchise will still able revive but my opinion not case all,1

The Wolf of Wall Street,film every definition word impeccable scorceses fantastic storytelling ability mixed phenomenal acting dicaprio hill rest cast makes awesome combination film never boring gives you glimpse into life man who had everything world only have taken away,10
The Wolf of Wall Street,mid1990s jordan belfort leonardo dicaprio rest his associates brokerage firm stratton oakmont became very definition excess debauchery their offices boiler room fueled cocaine greed high pressure sales tactic lessthanlegal behindthescenes manipulation bred plenty twentysomething millionaires belfort built himself empire top heap his rise fall chronicled wolf wall street based memoir same name,9
The Wolf of Wall Street,under most circumstances actions belfort his cronies including jonah hill howlingly funny turn belforts business partner would viewed disgustingly abhorrent but martin scorsese frames tale greed comedic lens allows us laugh things we probably shouldnt find humorous whether its clumsy attempt fisticuffs between two characters overdosing quaaludes categorization prostitutes using stock market terminology blue chip hookers make you wear condom typically accept credit cards film outrageous start finish rarely falters its quest entertain audience three hours,9
The Wolf of Wall Street,belfort manages delude himself his pals into thinking they can live like forever but audience knows better belforts eventual comeuppance hardly surprising but path paved hilarity especially scene aboard moguls luxury yacht where he surreptitiously offers pair fbi agents everything booze girls cold hard cash exchange their silence lets not forget his punishment drunkenly piloting helicopter into backyard his estate 3am raising ire his trophy wife margot robbie,9
The Wolf of Wall Street,scorsese has always managed elicit astounding performances his actors his fifth collaboration leonardo dicaprio results one most charismatic despicable offensive captivating characters ever appear screen financial bad boy belfort dicaprio swaggers scene scene ingesting eyepopping amounts narcotics groping fondling nearly every female within reach spouting more profanity three hours than entire season sopranos belfort kind person any sane person would detest real life but thanks scorses dicaprio we cant take our eyes off him,9
The Wolf of Wall Street,name,9
The Wolf of Wall Street,its no surprise scorsese associated gangster genre films such departed goodfellas casino which last two possibly best pure examples genre goodfellas gangsters dangerous but they operate more underground level casino they practically run major city can do whatever they like gangsters were will always part americas system now gangsters not just accepted system but considered integral part first two films gangster threatening dangerous but avoidable wolf wall street hes calling hustle you home you dont even know some people view wolf wall street glorification jordan belforts lifestyle want like him scorsese portrays life its nature enticing thats way works its impossible portray accurately without showing how charismatic man like belfort can suck unsuspecting person into world money fame film though shows us just how empty destructive life can,5
The Wolf of Wall Street,there undeniable similarity between instantaneous joy energy euphoria we have while watching wolf wall street how jordan belfort lives his life movie where director skillfully mixes form content create experience which hyper instantly ecstatic life its flashy opportunistic characters,10
The Wolf of Wall Street,direction martin scorsese which still has infectious energy power impeccable there no other director who has mastered pacing like he has threehour movie moves lightning fast always manages keep audience invested story throughout whole duration each scene packed so much visual information fast paced quickly edited which complements general tone film cinematography rodrigo prieto gorgeous well displays optimal color palette throughout whole film each shot also looks precise even during some more chaotic scenes,1
The Wolf of Wall Street,script fantastic filled many great memorable lines dialogue every character has welldefined arc motives story given proper breathing room blossom performances also exquisite especially leonardo dicaprio who gives one best performances his career portrays opportunistic nature jordan belforts character great commitment you can see lustful hedonistic impulsive sex drugaddict man who only wants have more fun supporting him equal passion jonah hill donnie azoff belforts sidekick even he manages make mark his own margot robbie plays naomi belforts second wife she does alluring job her given role matthew mcconaughey very short duration mark hanna belforts mentor but even little time he showstealer he dominates screen unlike anyone else,1
The Wolf of Wall Street,martin scorsese terence winter set out create film about wall street excess definition contains excessive amount everything such cursing sex nudity drugs alcohol partying but film not really about those things story wolf wall street boils down money mostaddictive drug belfort speaks not just what can buy but what can do people not just how changes ones lifestyle but effects has ones morals beliefs values how can effectively change not just how person thinks feels but how they operate their core,1
The Wolf of Wall Street,collection truly incredible films wolf wall street stands out one scorseses best films my personal favorite far his most humorous film date he truly went all out paid off hilarious satire reverence money drugs women admiration criminal moneymaker wolf wall street maddening cinema thats already high coke but still continues snort more white powder every 5 minutes 3 hours fascinating vignette excess greed abuse decay its one best movies decade surely one most entertaining movies ever made,8
The Wolf of Wall Street,film arrived uk awards oscar nominations all around adding expectation which really didnt need adding since even without any ultimately scorsese film big name cast also arrives some other stuff because film has been criticized near glamorization excesses belfort able experience his illgotten funds honest impression isnt helped when you consider film put forward golden globes musicalcomedy section now i am sure political move studio but does say something about film because indeed most we have stuff so unbelievable so excessive hard not laugh hard not enjoy,8
The Wolf of Wall Street,problem because first 2 hours bit film really engaging enchanting how much rush gives you how enticing just how much vibrant energy all has viewer swept along i guess point film doing its job well because not only we being told story but we first hand seeing how easy get caught up grab success money status regard film works really well because throughout film i really glad part wanted myself i dont think film goes out its way glamorize excess life but sure doesnt do much balance – really my problem film,1
The Wolf of Wall Street,structure subjects delivery film so inherently similar goodfellas hard not mention if you remember opening goodfellas youll remember opens memorably violent scene where neardead man back car stabbed hill his colleagues scene oppressive violent but yet ends narration telling us far back i can remember i wanted gangster snaps credits under big track tony bennett scene important because works microcosm whole film – appeal but also cost all one place wolf wall street never has any hurts i suspect message film our financial systems screwed ultimately rich will never same world average person because what i took rather sobering final scenes however if point trying make then really hurts itself rest film seeming say so why not get board i know not case but lack point agenda film means naturally fills its own which weird feeling,1
The Wolf of Wall Street,but then again – i guess comedy so infamous quaalude scene not horrific but rather hilarious scenes excess criminality not equally appealing repulsive – they almost totally appealing we hardly get other side get see victim here few seconds subway fbi agent really does nothing but yet again make suggestion its all broken so why not least get rich yourself getting away well made film scorsese makes award seasons second film owe massive debt goodfellas american hustle being other he directs film energy music used well one would expect editing makes film pop dicaprio great lead – ok he doesnt find heart character but film doesnt ask him instead he charismatic energetic drawing viewer giving film its energy supporting cast deep names familiar faces statement about how well film holds viewer because isnt distracting no matter how many famous faces supporting character tv appear although i did notice american hustle had lots faces hbos boardwalk empire jonah hill over top way works although i am surprised see him getting oscar nomination such crowded year,1
The Wolf of Wall Street,wolf wall street has had lot praise will continue oscars approach awarded personally i enjoyed film funny true story delivered energy excess but many ways not goodfellas most important these film lacks moral core itself its characters its message i dont mind its all screwed so who cares message ultimately seems give but i didnt feel comfortable how wide smile had its face while delivering,2
The Wolf of Wall Street,brilliantly acted superbly written one would expect picture martin scorsese masterclass directorial craft,1
The Wolf of Wall Street,showy when needs but also quiet contemplative wolf wall street equivalent something like good fellas even more so casino but set world finance suits might more expensive but people who wear them just sick violent their streetmob counterparts sardonic humor unflinching showing depravity its characters marks somewhat different approach world stocktrading than oliver stones wall street,5
The Wolf of Wall Street,where stone seems more line bertold brecht who considered theater case film moral institution does scorsese take position omnipresent observer dark side american many cases human dream,3

Pride & Prejudice,jane austens tale love economics reaches us once more energy thorough novelty pride prejudice has been favorite novel mine since i first read ive seen laurence olivier greer garson colin firth jennifer ehle now matthew macfadyen kiera knightly amazingly enough ive never been disappointed material seems full proof colin firths darcy many ways darcy ive always imagined hes been actor ive followed feverishly since his glorious adrian leduc apartment zero matthew macfadyen totally new me but he managed create sense longing makes final pay off so satisfying kiera knightly ravishing revelation i must confess i didnt remotely imagined she capable powerful range she brilliantly shows here other big surprise joe wright director his feature film debut which more than promising its extraordinary photography art direction spectacular supporting cast particular donald sutherland brenda blethyn makes new version perennial classic memorable evening movies,1
Pride & Prejudice,outstanding macfadyen worthy darcy darned good actor boot scenery backgrounds country folk were much more realistic than previous versions costumes hairdos also seemed keeping times another great addition priceless donald sutherland who perfect world would have had more scenes judy densch if those two cant chew up scenery nobody can finally keira knightly jewel her beauty so apparent almost detracts fact very good actress who can hold her own any room delight i only wish could have been 6 hours long,1
Becky,john wick meets home alone best way i can think describing when i first saw trailer i wanted watch film see kevin james dramaticdark performance he gives good performance but becky lulu wilson steals show sure not going win any awards but entertaining worth watch,7
Becky,another home invasion thriller brutal gory n fast paced time family which gets attacked stubborn girl n her father n her soon step mom n step bro usual home secluded n there r no nearby neighbors family attacked escaped neo nazi convicts young girl gave lovely performance but surprising see kevin james very different role film managed keep me glued know secret key but sequel shud made about key n lulu getting special training n recruitment,8
Becky,movie should called bambo teenage girl weighs about 90 pounds turns vigilante few 200 pound dudes making their lives pure hell not only does she do jackie chan kick off tree house swing she has terminator like wit using original one liners painful watch kevin james perform over hour type tomfoolery leprechaun hood better than film film gave me hope my next book can become academy award winning film so wasnt all bad im just playing actually pretty horrible marshmallow fire seen end epic,2
Becky,ive never left review here before but i feel entitled leave one now movie waste 90 minutes makes zero sense any way completely unsatisfying ending casting kevin james joel mchale complete wastewatch if you really want see action but other than i simply cant reccomend very poorly done film,4
Becky,how 4 men who have escaped prison arent able take down one little girl im huge kevin james fan but thiswas waste time,1
Becky,surprisingly good story line gore like home alone but realist consequences traps secret key story good you ponder further,8
Becky,movie off its head not realistic yet your face boldits not scared show you bloodthere some graphic scenes yet its more intense revolves around young girlacting great set way movie delivers exceptional,8
Becky,not what i expecting all loved i gripped throughout funny gory kinda fantastic,9
Becky,unrealistic teenage empowerment flick zero character development,2
Becky,sure sullen bratty becky easy hate beginning moviebut who didnt like watching growling becky exacting gory justice watch just rewind killing scenes course its sequelready,6
Becky,i think almost everyone enjoys see comedian break away laughs turn serious role case even villainous kevin james executes extremely played out cliche aryan brotherhoodsupremacistconvict character well he couldve what barren script he given,6
Becky,everything starts out some solid character development young lulu wilson her struggles current emotional situation things progress we fly ahead into start action introduced ever cliche written group villains intensity mystery point appears though they will explain certain plot device which antagonists after but they fail do so then things start getting gruesome very fast paced you still wonder what they truly after towards final act just when you think theyll explain what point all we once again left hanging without any true explanation their intentions main object they were after rendering whole story nearly useless other than extreme brutality revenge empowerment,4
Becky,i mentioned film has some decently entertaining performances james wilson some solid production value but there almost no story here if they wouldve simply given explanation motives these convicts wrapped up some loose ends couldve been slightly better instead just feels like hollow cliche revenge thriller,4
Becky,movie soso mediocre plot story line very weak could better so many ways but writer failed do so,6
Becky,only good thing about movie lulu wilsons acting shes true gem new risingstar horrorthriller genre films,7
Becky,becky ridiculous unsatisfying wouldbethriller which never thrilling never believable even fails shock down fact graphic violence resorts more likely bring laughter than unease ridiculous character arc taken titular becky which completely leaves any semblance believability behind,7
Becky,most movie i reminded one those forgotten thrillers were everywhere back 90s how hard make good thriller must nigh impossible given how many there how few manage thrill setup pretty typical family reeling death their matriarch beset escaped convicts looking missing key some reason located family home,3
Becky,you know modern movie however two reasons ridiculous overthetop violence fact movie goes similarly ridiculous girl power tangent where we see thirteenyearold facing off against four five hardened criminals,1
Becky,about violence one scene man gets stabbed eye goes back into house his eyeball dangling out its nerve he asks another guy cut nerve you do guy fails do apparently not cutting hard enough butcher knife so guy cuts his own eyeball off instead,1
Becky,i did not see movie theatre but if i had i bet scene would have been laugh riot its like something out horror comedy yet movie not comedic all,9
Becky,despite course presence paul blart himself kevin james comedians have played villainous roles before great effect ie robin williams insomnia one hour photo jerry lewis king comedy movie kevin james shows us he does not have him he not intimidating all role,1
Becky,ridiculousness movies violence converges neatly its girlpower angle any movie about somebody surviving turning tables group bad guys features person unleashing their inner macgyver ie fashioning traps tools matter moments but who expected girl such enthusiastic participant carnage,1
Becky,its not like movie shies away realisation but doesnt make any less stupid,2
Becky,i actually really liked one i also dont get why people arent liking one guess they dont like fun movies,1
Becky,there many films made along same theme but one entertains becky has bad attitude resentful thirteen year old adolescent girl these habits become her assets hour need when she stubbornly becomes very resourceful solves various problems put her way,1
Radioactive,movie ok actors great science part story though they dont show much but some reason cuts future multiple times bomb drop chernobyl but fails show governments companies involved so sort implies madame curie reasonable those events which ridiculous its like saying newton responsible all plane crashes because he discovered gravity,7
Radioactive,its not clear what message they attempting send film they trying convey marie curie genius idiot one point film people already making claims radiation causing health issues long after concern expressed marie still sleeping apparently least sometimes carrying around bottle full radium almost like talisman yet she then tells her daughter should doesnt wont her working any radioactivityrelated research because radioactivity could endanger her health having not read any biographies about marie i just cant help but wonder if any based upon factual evidence all just embellishment dramatic effect,4
Radioactive,then film interleaved numerous future events midst telling maries story each these segments depicts mostly horrific events related future uses radioactivebased inventions eg nuclear weapons nuclear reactor meltdown etc what does any have do marie curie she didnt invent radiation radioactive material simply exists she just happened discover some its elements showing all those future events sure seems send mixed message seeming imply marie curies culpability those events which course ridiculous each those future insertions just seemed completely unrelated telling her life story they were my opinion simply waste time useless distraction,6
Radioactive,film has some excellent actors its cast but i just felt like they were misused giving you only shallow confusing look life important scientific pioneer i dont mean imply unwatchable but someone else has already said seems more like soap opera than legitimate biographical account,5
Radioactive,marie curie became more prominent after her death especially around early years century so film about her life achievements welcome view there few changes facts probably make move more dramatic but perhaps book which film derives written like tough days marie curies life when she arrived paris hardly touched which undoubtedly lead her stubborn attitude which over characterized film real life she not such hard difficult person,6
Radioactive,although movie title radioactive i though story about marie curie im disappointed so much included not related research achievements pierre marie curie eg atomic bomb dropped hiroshima chernobyl disaster neither which related polonium radium which were discoveries marie curie only thing they have common they radioactive,6
Radioactive,distinct lack ppe but still wouldnt shield you some pretty poor editing story condensed into 100 minutes about great woman who deserves so much more but seems get blame hiroshima chernobyl well errant husbands,3
Radioactive,historical figure impact significant marie curie really underwhelming biopic stale rushed lacking any insightful emotional depth radioactive dull watch throughout failing its attempt capture both significance curies discoveries her own personal struggles,7
Radioactive,its so strange how poor film given immense talent behind screen rosamund pike sam riley star while persepolis director marjane satrapi helms film yet despite talent radioactive feels almost amateurish its worst,6
Radioactive,its screenplay poor throughout its lack dramatic insight its consistently terrible dialogue early moments film insufferable chronicling maries meeting future husband pierre through scenes awkward forced scientific flirting,9
Radioactive,later radioactive tries grab your attention its assessment standing women scientific community but does little make theme really get under your skin fact most memorable part theme curies repeated assertions not her gender stood most her way scientist time but her background funds,5
Radioactive,relatively little focus her background there isnt much inspiring uplifting arc curie here instead there few eureka moments interspersed long dry dull periods barely any memorable drama show,2
Radioactive,even stranger way which film tries represent longterm controversial effects curies discovery radioactivity almost randomly film throws bizarre vignettes future showing uses discovery good bad including bombing hiroshima development nuclear weapons,6
Radioactive,all but ruins any narrative flow film only reinforcing fact radioactive really bit amateurish work marjane satrapis generally unappealing style drab direction do little keep you engaged while even leads like sam riley extent rosamund pike below their best,6
Radioactive,its real shame because its clear marie curies great story so much talent working film you would expect whole lot more radioactive but painfully dull stale even amateurish biopic theres little positive say about,7
Radioactive,movies takes heavy duty subject interesting mostly only those who care about science scientific leapof progress attempts turn into something fit public consumption oh course pressed into 110 minutes valiant effort but fails mostly everything except some decent visuals science gets butchered starting omitting conoblist jacques becquerel entirely scientific history gets butchered massively possibly offending scientifically minded audiences story stays utterly tepid lukewarm loving clicheed imagery france grows utterly trite when movie tries depict pierre curie stealing maries thunder noble price after fighting valiantly get her included honour first place flatout lying about whole procedure maries presence even rosamunde pike struggles what director requires her carry especially some most forsaken dialog possible one clearly notices director visualized factspoor graphic novel,7
Radioactive,flashbacks flashforwards do stray realm overly melodramatic driving home some binary unnuanced utterly stereotypical assumptions there short flash forward episode showing chernobyl which given last years nf series feels utterly silly looses what energy had extremely quickly after pierre curie passes out story,9
Radioactive,bows too much current zeitgeist ignores realities established facts about real events loosing outstanding contributions marie curie made science process would have made spectacular movie i would not recommend even hagiographic biopic,4
Radioactive,rosamund pike has penchant playing determined women navigating oppressive maledominated environments femme fatale gone girl war photographer marie colvin last years private war latest example radioactive pike delivers powerful embodiment another tragic hero named marie pioneering physicist chemist marie curie pike delivers dazzling performance rich struggles life defined perilous discoveries great personal loss directed marjane satrapi discursive biopic struggles whenever cuts away her drama explore bigger picture peculiar flashforwards nuclear future but pike helps fuse together unfortunately movies unorthodox structure stumbles when veers off heavyhanded tangents explain reverberations curies research pike remains compelling figure into old age anyone unfamiliar curie family legacy will certainly find much appreciate about their various accomplishments under incredible personal duress tremendous social upheaval so overall gud moovie,2
Radioactive,greetings again darkness there can never enough movies made books written about remarkable people incredible accomplishments marie curie certainly remarkable woman her accomplishments were such scientific breakthroughs we still using them today director marjane satrapis oscar nominated persepolis 2007 film based 2010 book radioactive marie pierre curie tale love fallout lauren redniss screenplay adapted jack thorne aeronauts 2019,5
Radioactive,film opens 1934 paris we see enfeebled marie curie rosamund pike collapse get rushed hospital sequence used director satrapi framing device film quickly flashes back 1893 when headstrong brilliant twentysomething marie salomea sklodowska gets kicked out her laboratory being well bit too headstrong times soon she meets equally headstrong also brilliant scientist named pierre curie sam riley pierre recognizes potential if they combine forces while marie initially demands her independence having never found another scientist worthy efforts required collaboration,6
Radioactive,initial flirtations between brainy scientists clumsy awkward one might expect general film struggles how best address curies personal life her professional life challenges she faced brilliant woman era when male scientists didnt much appreciate woman scientist telling them they have misunderstood atom she her husband announce discovery not one but two new elements radium polonium romance science equality lot one film tackle one flounders bit,10
Radioactive,film science progress director satrapi intersperses flashforward vignettes show how curies discovery radioactivity used future both good not so good these droppedin segments include cancer treatment little boy 1957 enola gay bombing hiroshima 1945 atomic bomb test 1961 nevada course 1986 chernobyl disaster segments arent always smooth transition curies story but they make point how scientists dont always have control over how their discoveries applied there even scene where pierre shows marie some comical uses entrepreneurs found trying capitalize their discovery how their work might factor everyday life,6
Radioactive,biography profile marie curies life accomplishments film hits high notes though we do wish dug bit deeper gender prejudices times somewhat underplayed even marie herself claims lack funds fact she wasnt natural born parisian held her back more than roadblocks she faced female scientist would seem reasonable those issues were likely tied together should not separated she lashes out pierre regarding nobel committee initially keeping her name off submission but course anger misplaced pierre demanded she included,8
Radioactive,historical aspect her winning two nobel prizes not treated astonishing accomplishment but time spent personal scandal occurred after pierres death we do see marie sleeping sample her radioactive uranium watch her slow physical deterioration including incessant cough damaged skin late film anya taylorjoy plays her daughter irene we see two them head onto battlefield provide mobile xray devices injured soldiers curie family tree filled renowned scientists irene her husband frederick jointly won nobel prize 1935 artificial radioactivity some these discoveries literally changed world including cancer treatments perhaps its unrealistic expect any movie capture historical importance marie curie but we somehow left feeling she deserved better,4
Desperados,movies premise very old kinda been done lot times already,4
Desperados,one more boring ones i found my self not really watching but rather just letting wash over me there nothing grasp onto,4
Desperados,then i realised dialogue terrible so unfunny bad delivery lines also not great but i do wonder if they were like i cant believe they making me say,1
Desperados,plot also paper thin times i think got bored its self kinda wanders off does irrelevant things then hopes back what meant focusing,2
Desperados,i read movie has been development since 2009 long time ago 11 years i think shows isnt anything fresh unfortunately i really like most leads,1
Desperados,yes theres scene where dolphin eagerly humps nasim pedrad then slaps her face his dolphin dick aptly represents general flavour humour yet another fairly terrible netflix original,3
Desperados,im giving 4 out ten because there were couple funny scenes cast set were well styled but screen writing ugh screen writing usual these scraping bottom barrel originals complete garbage,2
Desperados,movie nothing but cliches bad acting recycled tropes dynamic between woman playing main character little boy resort creepy inappropriate exploitation minor actor,1
Desperados,ill start stating my 2 star rating only due loving most actors film i would have thought combination would have gone off much better than did,2
Desperados,storyline painfully erratic nothing really grab instead enjoying experience youll kind just waste time watching something without taking anything remember other words its total waste hour half your life youll never get back thats saying lot while most us stuck home quarantine too much free time,1
Desperados,its shame they brought together great group missed mark entirely story any sort,1
Desperados,also whats uncomfortable child adult live connection joke cringeworthy first sentence they kept going throughout decent length film i dont know how script ever got green light,1
Desperados,if youre looking great netflix comedy isnt its not even decent instead i recommend you watch eurovision song contest story fire saga itll bring you laughs even some tears joy,1
Desperados,congratulations movie so bad actually moved me write review,1
Desperados,desperadoes train wreck start cgi dolphin dong then went downhill there whichever scriptwriter came up needs go strike again i truly hope none those involved clear i previously liked all three recognisable faces ever live down,2
Desperados,early guaranteed winner worst movie 21st century,4
Desperados,i turned because i love nasim pedrad trailer looked funny but absolutely awful there were couple funny moments but most jokes were not funny completely gross plot painful ridiculous,4
Desperados,why does netflix keep making movies like lamorne morris charming but rest movie painful watch,1
Desperados,seriously just dont waste your time watching i usually can bear pathetic movie doing fast forward but just broke my patience all levels do something unproductive stupid pass your time rather wasting watching youll thank me later,6
Desperados,soon i saw sean same resort her i knew exactly what going happen whole little boy thing really creepy not needed i feel like film way too long i really wanted like film i watched preview netflix looked good but its so cringe typical friends falling out over something stupid making up her finding man her dreams,7
Desperados,dull uninspired story line questionable acting ending you can predict first 10 minutes,4
Desperados,2020 just so sad so many people movie didnt help uplift those who subscribed netflix during lockdown,7
Desperados,they say room worst i actually watched room curiosity weird excitement i felt like i want punch screen my laptop every 5 minutesi honestly dont even know where start everything about movies ridiculous first all plot so flat predictable banal you just want finish before stars bad way not like end world ridiculous funny silly way its like copy every simple comedy decent characters combined into not funny boring bad shot bad acted movie no chemistry between actors whatsoever only character carrying weight decency sean probably only positive aspect movie dialogue horrible sounds like written acting students sunday night monday assignment honestly im not even mean do not hope single lough its not gonna happen bad plot no chemistry flat boring too long i feel like movie sucked piece my soul away threw sewer,1
Desperados,they resort dialog loaded f word vulgarity mentions sex,4
Desperados,formula simple has been used ad nauseam but once one removes these elements dialog there very little left behind,4
Midsommar,let me first say not bad movie utilizes creative camera work cinematography add narrative but i personally still didnt like its main goal my opinion disturb viewer much possible through use sound gory visuals feeling isolation insanity while i can see how can speak certain audience didnt appeal me made me want turn movie quite few times if you into these kinds films definitely give try but if you like me enjoy being scared horror movie instead weirded out disturbed might not you,4
Midsommar,ill start off warning if youre mainstream horror fan you will not like not conjuring does not have jump scares slow movie its not scary way most horror films scary doesnt frighten you felt traumatic artsy movie sure if you dont like dont see,10
Midsommar,florence pugh absolutely phenomenal she provides heart film what keeps audience emotionally invensted such disturbing film its one greatest horror performances i have ever seen,3
Midsommar,cinematography stunningly gorgeous ive never seen film look so gory grotesque yet absolutely beatiful same time its some best cinematography ive seen years art direction also phenomenal providing us floral candy colored nightmare world,1
Midsommar,ari asters screenplay direction what makes so special separates other horror pieces its slow methodical eerie but characters psychological deep dialogue real colorful plot surreal disturbing he lets scares crawl you opposed jump you he allows you see what will happen process feel shock whats about happen then still shock you even more when happens,7
Midsommar,film will divisive i have no doubt many people here will hate however while challenging film its also great film halfway through character says something along lines so messed up but im trying keep open mind i suggest audiences take advice,1
Midsommar,psa movie extremely violent bloody gory its pretty horrifying could have stuff triggering,1
Midsommar,im sure im missing some higher deeper meaning but i just found boring pointless,2
Midsommar,i watching i commented several times cinematography itself but even so i starved some sort narrative not mention pacing film so agonizingly slow i could have walked out room any time returned see there had been no progression story itself characters all unlikeable two dimensional protagonists trauma beginning film never addressed again doesnt contribute anything all what little story there film basically perfect example things happening slowly no climax resolution but they get away because director decides put trippy elements make no sense fake audience out false deeper meaning its lazy writing so much violence nudity cheap shot keep audience uncomfortable but so overused abused they can hardly take these unsettling elements seriously,1
Midsommar,im not sure how but movie had me edge entire time you have enjoy cinematography really enjoy i left movie like i just came down high whole thing felt like bad trip afterwards i pleased not same time but i think thats how were meant feel its good change super hero movies terribly made horror movies,1
Midsommar,film cant saved even undeniable cinematography its unbearably slow violence gratuitous epically fails horror movie any level midsommar tries psychologically terrifyingdisturbing but misses mark because characters hollow flat,1
Midsommar,theater burst into loud laughter several points because film becomes so absurd you stop caring entirely about who dies how they die will they live,1
Midsommar,not sure what supposed its definitely not horror movie its not even scary has few unsettling moments but thats its just weird doesnt really have any dramatic arc raising tension basically whole movie few strangers saying wtf constantly everyone else telling them ts ok guys also besides its revolves around traumatized annoying totally without self respect girl slowly starts benefiting weird place because course we cannot have film these days without being personal journey some sorts writers trying smart deep yeah nothing beats bizzare crazy rituals make you sane,2
Midsommar,if youre expecting horror monsters supernatural keep going its just weird film no real ending resolution interesting character events albeit nice filmography quite good actors has no real dramatic structure captivating story,1
Midsommar,i suspect reviewers who believe movie weirdest most deranged trippedout film theyve ever seen have not watched many movies i recommend you watch wicker man 1973 alejandro jodorowskys holy mountain sergei parajanovs color pomegranates before you watch watered down pretentious murk order get sense how movies can truly mindaltering story essentially every cliché slasher genre mashed together group young people naively go into wilderness sweden very scary place lol encounter messed up stuff they each die one one spoiler alert there final girl who survives end rest cliché story fluff if you think based trailer much film will mirror original wicker man you exactly right there even big fire end where guy gets burned alive there fine line between homage ripoff may great example film slips over edge into complete ripoff territory i wont even go into all logical loopholes story scenario point out none customs line up all ancient scandinavian rituals thus making one wonder why even takes place sweden begin like why couldnt cult upstate ny because theres no point script doesnt even attempt deep research here subwikepedia level characters cookiecutter types youve seen before million other horror movies one logical question i would ask however how come all these people anthropology phd students going research scandinavian paganism but none them speak swedish has writer ever even talked someone phd all said florence pugh talented actress does great job shallow script she transcends material shows she can powerful dramatic actress cinematography gorgeous too editing sound pitch perfect i especially taken set design use furniture quirky wall paintings give film sense intricate beauty contrast horror all really fabulous people who worked these aspects film should commended all cosmetic however without mask beautiful production gifted actress director writer aster has absolutely nothing going here hereditary very good solid horror film i wonder if aster didnt rush into sophomore effort too soon seems like script he could have banged out night especially since feels like something made out other films also seems aster repeats some same tricks hereditary using shocking gaspar noélike violence relying making his audience feel uncomfortable sight incongruously naked people running around these stock images going get old really fast him he needs work building up scares really pay off there will people who love director who swept away cool style photography film who have simply never seen any hundreds other movies out there strange imagery creepy paganism these people going think movie mindblower thats nice but please watch wicker man 1973 first before you fall love dumpster fire,1

Back to the Future,i cannot recommend movie enough i have never found movie other than one provides such huge dose great fun has desirable quality where you able see something new each time you see only problem they stopped part iii,10

Back to the Future,gets solid 9 out 10 comedy fantasy gorgeous lea thompson insane but comic doc typical teenager marty make film must all young heart,10
Back to the Future,zemeckiss back future trilogy has been childhood favourite long time having revisited today brought me nostalgic state 80s saw lot excellent original fun young films like back future course better off dead heathers breakfast club etc what really made these films immensely enjoyable then classics today they really reflected what like being young person 80s movies themselves were well written well executed well acted they cut straight point,10
Back to the Future,back back future one sheer fun even today theres incredible energy about but still manages stay innocent film music very effective its slick follows steady pace special effects decent though people might pick plausibility time travelling i think really very minor flaw because overall well written movie point entertain yet not say its brainless entertainment i think cleverly brings forth some interesting themes i liked how they funnily used some ideas oedipus rexs story,10
The Dark Knight,confidently directed dark brooding packed impressive action sequences complex story dark knight includes careerdefining turn heath ledger well other oscar worthy performances tdk remains not only best batman movie but comic book movie ever created,10
The Dark Knight,i got see dark knight wednesday night reason though why im writing movie comment late because i didnt wanna just jump say movie awesome i wanted think through still today i cant stop thinking about movie dark knight lives up its hype goes beyond batman movie goes where no other batman movie has gone before gave us real sold story we finally told why villains way they how all injustice world can get underneath batmans skin how you have believe people still have faith good earth heath ledger i absolutely loved jack nicolsons performance 1989 film when i first read heath signed onto dark knight i like what they kidding once you see dark knight heath incredible im not going compare jack heaths performance because they were two different versions joker but heaths joker definitely more scary intense two nominations you didnt know what he going do next he so crazy he also so charismatic point where you could relate his character worst part not only hes crazy hes driving gotham crazy treating everyone like little puppets strings he can control guess what he doing so well smile his face,10
The Dark Knight,so much more than batman film so much more than comic book film dark knight truly delivers drama action romance horror dark humor study psychopathic killer detective story force behind epic movie christopher nolan whos previous film batman begins didnt really thrill me but his incredible film making truly shown dark knight shots he got gotham city were absolutely fantastic made you feel part city part batman story one things i absolutely loved about dark knight normally comic book movie you know its not real people dont dress up costumes save day villains dont name themselves crazy names dress make up crazy costumes but dark knight actually makes seem incredibly real like could happen,10
The Dark Knight,bruce wayne still learning how his double life batman himself he has lost rachel new district attorney harvey dent hes inspiring others who dressing up batman trying take villains city themselves but things much worse when joker waltzes into town hes going bring hell upon gotham city constantly playing gothams mind trying get batman reveal himself batman has never dealt such psychopathic genius before joker has named himself classy villain gotham needs he also has brought new thought into batmans head them actually being more alike than different batman completes him joker would nothing without him but batman relying harvey dent who gothams white knight trying put all gothams scum jail but when joker plays batman commissioner gordon harvey rachel find themselves very horrific position harvey must discover if he will die hero live long enough become villain,9
The Dark Knight,all performances dead movie now everyones going crazy over heath ledgers performance but one performance i would also love credit aaron eckhart who plays harvey denttwo face his performance just great heaths made two face human villain you could understand his hatred vengeance what happened him why he became two face i know everyone saying but i truly mean when i say one best movies i have seen very long time we had some great movies these past few years but i think dark knight seriously something special but i dont wanna build up too much since some people go theater expecting my words same your own my opinion though not great movie i cant come up word describe how incredibly powerful movie honest i would go above 10 rating if i could batman film we have been waiting ive seen twice one weekend im going see three times upcoming week i dont mind one bit i cant wait sequel i would just like say rip heath wish he could have seen his breath taking performance joker,10
The Dark Knight,10oct,10
The Dark Knight,weve been subjected enormous amounts hype marketing dark knight weve seen joker scavenger hunts one largest viral campaigns advertising history culminates actual release movie,10
The Dark Knight,everything thats been said pretty much spot first time i can remember where summer blockbuster film far surpasses hype,10
The Dark Knight,much action there movie its acting makes great piece work between all punches explosions stuntwork some great dialog work all actors have their moments,9
The Dark Knight,bales batman definitive batman because we see everything character finally film martial arts skills cunning great tactical thinking forensic application technological genius advance improve luscious foxs inventionstechnological breakthroughs intimidating personality even little swashbuckling,10
The Dark Knight,heath yes he gets credit his performance joker but you have also recognize jonathan chris nolan writing treatment character its not just fact ledger makes joker so menacing but nolans have given character great manifesto drives its actions jokers stance chaos order anarchy morality average modern human being make character so interesting psychologically nolans drafted complex character only perfect performance couldve pulled something like off thats how difficult role thats why ledgers performance so great,10
The Dark Knight,isnt action movie its film explores literary themes hero villain well order anarchy yes listen dialog because its all there,10
The Dark Knight,first id controversially like point out movie wouldnt have gotten much hype did if wasnt heath ledgers death before release academy not being afraid give oscar corpse,10
The Dark Knight,nevertheless his performance easily best one superhero genre crafty well put together new york accent confirms he put lot dedication effort into his methodical role deserved what he got oscar isnt just another batman movie anymore yes there action explosions stunt work but between masterfully crafted dialogue dwells deep,10
The Dark Knight,batman his definitive self now we finally see fullest his character christian bale does him justice christopher nolan praised created complex characters given each one justifiable treatment thats reason cast works everyone holds their own there no lazily written neglected characters,10
The Dark Knight,beautiful cinematography presentation gotham visuals endeavours cast dark knight film easily gets top every superhero list certainly one remember remember long time,10
The Dark Knight,final grade 910,10
The Dark Knight,i couldnt believe dark knight could live up hype thats perhaps biggest surprise secret i believe stunning mature intelligent script makes best superhero movie ever made if wasnt enough heath ledger he newest tragic modern icons present us preview something well never see fearless extraordinary actor capable fill up humanity even most grotesque villains his performance master class fortunately christian bales batman almost supporting character bale good but there something around his mouth stops him being great dark knight visually stunning powerful moving what else could anyone want,10
The Dark Knight,just what you want best movie great story great acting thrilling twist just watched joker 2019 i just has come back give dark knight 10 thanks heath ledger exceptional performs,10
The Dark Knight,im just gonna start off saying i love movieits one my favorites all time i honestly cant think too much wrong movie other than its little long batmans now infamous voice but everything else top notch actingstoryatmosphereand actions scenes all amazing if you havent seen movie see right now i went into not expecting much but i came out blown away i cant imagine any movie being much better ill just have wait dark knight rises release see if anything can better until then stands best movie ive ever seen,10
The Dark Knight,i saw dark knight about three years ago when i 8th grade i blown away how beautifully done camera work acting story all took me surprise day one best movies i have ever seen will see no other movie can impact you such intense way than dark knight movie worth seeing due fact workers put so much time effort into one film they did not want waste money putting up garbage so christopher nolan thank you not wasting our time instead earning our time film day i still am anxious see movie home i recommend anyone who likes action movies general anyone who doesnt dont waste your time write bad reviews about film,10
The Dark Knight,brilliant tense movie beginning end which tells story rising new menace gotham city known only joker how dark knight has reach his limits trying control havoc he breaks gotham city,10
The Dark Knight,movie extraordinary piece filmmaking art all its aspects plot carefully smartly written intricately wrought canvas character development very satisfying movie shot well nicely directed epic score fits scenes add up whole visual experience acting intense all cast where each fit their role perfectly specially heath ledger who managed after all these years having joker around comic books animations tv series even movies literally bring complicated character all its twisted brilliant sadistic dark sometimes funny personality live big screen last movie heath ledger filmed completely i believe some how he saved best last he managed put outstanding final act realistic joker managed put smile our faces before death brings down curtains his talent,10
The Dark Knight,dark yes complex ambitious christopher nolan his cowriter jonathan nolan deserve standing ovation i dont usually go loud movies filled mindless gore violence dark knight certainly loud violent but its not mindless has depth soul even joker extraordinary creation heath ledger deeply human natural petulance christian bale makes his ego alter ego most fascinating complex all film superheroes part genius movie batman himself screen time not really lead my attention captivated heath ledger he determines inspires breathtaking atmosphere envelopes gotham well us aplomb christopher nolan director mind blowing his secret i believe his obvious respect his audience what hes done elevate popular genre into shakesperean proportions bravo,8

Inception,my 3rd time watching movie yet still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment left me many thoughts afterward,10
Inception,someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how christopher nolan had illustrated every single characteristic dream big screen its been done so sophisticatedly i do believe rumour nolan had spent 10 years finish script inception my opinion its been so far greatest achievement his brilliant writerdirector career i jumped into conclusion after making quick benchmark nolans remarkable works,9
Inception,spoilers ahead all who havent watched movie you may stop reading right here because following paragraphs contain ton spoilers,10
Inception,set world where theres technology allows people literally share dream there world new kind corporate spy extractors who use technology infiltrate targets subconscious extract valuable information through shared dream world our hero mr cobb leonardo dicaprio very wellknown extractor his partner arthur joseph gordonlevitt approached powerful businessman mr saito ken watanabe nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before instead steeling he wants them plant idea persons subconscious which also called inception return saito offers something cobb could never resist ticket go home his children taking out homicide charge against him so cobb arthur gather team carry out mission eames tom hardy veteran identity forger yusuf only one chemist can make such powerful sedative such complex 3levels dream within dream ariadne ellen page newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role critical success mission target robert fischer cillian murphy son heir saitos biggest competitor maurice fischer whos dying goal seed idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business team has carry saito visitor their mission let him verify result inception while team go deeper deeper into fischers mind we discover gradually dark cobbs past well 2 biggest why concerning our hero why he has became such expert inception what his desperate motivation taking insane mission,10
Inception,movie not only about inception mission but more importantly about struggle finding way maze life cobbs case its maze dreams built his memories his past wife mal marion cotillard his regrets so long he let himself consumed past blaming himself death his love wife will keep coming back haunt his present deeper team go into dream more dangerous his subconscious under form his ghostly wife comes out could anytime jeopardize mission indeed if we apprehend movie these 2 layers its story ending scene makes perfect sense yes were now talking about famous ending which has still remained one most controversial movie endings cinema history did cobb find mr saito limbo bring he back complete mission then come back his children real world they still stuck limbo infinite dream world last scene just his big dream but all those question only matter first layer story result inception mission when we perceive story its deeper layer journey cobb let go his feeling guilt past refind meaning his life ending did fulfill its job cobb didnt even stay see either if spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important him he gonna his kids he did finally get rid his haunting past able move matters after all dream reality importance truly live so point view he has solved maze his life,9
Inception,some short lines about cast,10
Inception,id like keep my review rather point,10
Inception,pros 1 its theme dream fascinating topic say least there lot unknowns dreamworld,10
Inception,2 its plot there several sweet twists unpredictable turns,10
Inception,3 its edgy drive although you know whats coming next still you feel jumpy about when does,10
Inception,4 its rapid storyline story moves fast one scene another making viewers feel like roller coaster ride times its hard keep up even after watching several times,8
Inception,5 its sophistication there lot information remember digest very thing modern moviegoers after i believe,10
Inception,6 its realism okay pun intended movie explains least tries ins outs what dream about how functions some which very familiar dear us,10
Inception,cons 1 its poor character development although acting convincing enough there not enough character development i wonder how many people really felt connected main characters after watching movie yes movie talks about emotional struggles but more action film than anything else if you ask me,6
Inception,2 too many distractions i found movie had more characters than necessary they may play certain roles plot but they seemed more distractions than anything else i wish movie more focused,5
Inception,3 bit preachy i noticed characters would explain things about dreamworld then exact things happen later movie im afraid inception overused trick,9
Inception,conclusion its theme fascinating but its delivery not without room improvement,2
Inception,i highly recommend you go read somewhere carnal over 40 winks if you dig kind flicks,3
Inception,cheers,1
Inception,what most resilient parasite idea yes nolan has created something his unbelievably incredibly god gifted mind which will blow minds audience away world premiere movie directed hollywoods most inventive dreamers shown london has already got top notch reviews worldwide has scored maximum points now question arises what movie has deserve all,4
Inception,dom cobbdi caprio extractor who paid invade dreams various business tycoons steal their top secret ideas cobb robs forcefully psyche practiced skill though hes increasingly haunted memory his late wife mal marion cotillard who has nasty habit showing up his subconscious wreaking havoc his missions cobb had been involved so much his heist work he had lost his love,9
Inception,but then fate had decided wealthy business man saito ken watanabe hands over responsibility dissolving empire his business rival robert fischer jrcillian murphy but time his job not steal idea but plant new one inception,1
Inception,then what happens classic heist movie tradition carry out task cobbs brainiac specialists team up again him arthur joseph gordonlevitt his longtime organizer tom hardy eames forger who can shapeshift will yusuf dileep rao powerful sedative supplier,5
Inception,there only one word describe cinematography set designs special effects exceptional you dont just watch scenes happening you feel them movie real thrill ride action scenes well picturised music hans zimmer electronically haunting never runtime movie you will get chance move your eyes screen any other object,10
Inception,leonardo who still popularly known jack dawson played him titanic should relieved his role dom cobb will remembered forever his performance may may not fetch him oscar but will his finest performance till date supporting cast too did extraordinary work christopher nolan ah what man he his work nothing less than masterpiece he deserves all awards best director category if inception metaphysical puzzle its also metaphorical one its hard not draw connections between cobbs dreamweaving nolans film making intended seduce us mess our heads leave everlasting impression,1
1917,last night col ferry i col coldwell both usa were able watch new wwi film 1917 before has national release cinematographic feast eyes long expansive shots follow protagonists they execute their mission does not hide horrors existed trench warfare shows them their brutality abundance my great uncle died consequence his service fighting trenches mustard gas poisoning many ways reminded me saving private ryan,10
1917,those who have served combat i have deployments iraq afghanistan i cannot tell you if film will too difficult watch might well especially if incoming artillery trigger me camera travels few inches above dirt advancing slowly up berm my response visceral i taken back patrols we walked afghanistan not knowing what around corner not relaxing heightened vigilance not knowing if there would ied child wearing suicide vest sniper taking aim protagonists film all who served serving surviving climb up berm there no sigh relief no respite fear uncertainty they we survive move forward face more uncertainty,10
1917,watching allowed me pay homage my great uncle approximate 800000 other brits who were killed died consequence their service germany lost over 2 million soldiers war estimates put total casualty numbers both military civilians 40 million half killed died woundsinfection,10
1917,i rate film 1010 many reasons directing acting set design cinematography musical score raw emotion invokes some critics have said they never felt connection characters i suspect they never served combat while brotherhood including female war fighters strong there also common characteristic possessed all war fighters ability focus mission suppress emotion even those around fighter fall quality i recognized actors why viewer doesnt bond main protagonists we viewer were mission them we grieve we can move,10
1917,watch if you will but know there no pleasure watching film will grab you beginning not let you go even though we know outcome wwi there no joy there no peace watch because will allow you glimpse horror brutality war reflect their service sacrifice note we viewer walking through trenches glancing shots young soldiers shows them flat affect isolation almost apathy face shell shock what we know call posttraumatic stress disorder,10
1917,original ww1 footage watch they shall never grow old exceptional documentary,10
1917,i sat packed yet silent theater morning watched what i believe next academy award winner best picture im not all fan war movies but i am fan great moviesand 1917 great movie i have never been so mesmerized set design direction mass human emotion film astonishingly captured embedded magically audience keeps running through my mindthe poetry beauty intertwined raw misery war treat yourselfsee movie,9
1917,film overwhelming i have nothing further add other than compelling need eternal remembrance those who sacrificed their lives any way we can not fathom we citizens any country today should feel ourselves lucky blessed exist happy new year all george hellas nb do not give second thought watch even if genre not your cup tea after all much more than feature film its massive dedication unselfishness do yourself favour watch then watch once more,10
1917,dont listen critics saying movie boring movie one most tense exciting movies ive seen years amazing cinematography overall amazing experience movie,7
1917,1917 poem most deep impressive realistic way seeing what kinds things happened wwi movie made me leave movies tears my eyes if i have had time travel experience world war i then waking up realizing how wonderful times we living 1917 must see movie everyone,10
1917,guaranteed oscar technical visual triumph bravo roger deakins,6
1917,its stunning watch start finish amount work went into film alone deserves your attendance even then story never stalls has fair balance between war humanity has some most incredible camera work ive seen while its hands down my favorite film 2019,5
1917,hands down one greatest war movies ever hit silver screen along being very unique hell wwi battlefield subject hasnt been covered long time mr mendes executes perfectly movie like couldnt have been made 50 years ago but todays advances film making along large studio budget mr mendes takes us through adventure every bit harrowing saving private ryan thin red line,5
1917,use single shot brilliant brings viewer along trenches further adds realism film i surprised hear gimmicky effect some critics i feel mr mendes nailed brilliantly help some fantastic cinematography set pieces were so realistic detailed lesser director wouldve focused more them but ride camera never stops moving its benefit film,7
1917,there no slow part movie audience enthralled journey first minute film dialogue great certainly key component making single shot method work here there no pointless exposition movie,8
1917,isnt piece glorify war but rather demonstrate how one can brave all while showing their vulnerabilities fear any normal person would feel type situation there no gratuitous bits film exemplify heroism just simple story allows characters shine define bravery their own terms,8
1917,acting score cinematography editing overall direction film mr mendes absolutely knocked out park isnt just one best war movies all time i believe its truly one best pieces film ever grace big screen 1917 will leave you breathless many like myself tears when journey comes end,8
1917,bravo,10
1917,still wasnt fully satisfying me,6
1917,obviously story pretty much one line deliver message ok not every movie needs packed story but then shouldnt waste too much time either should faster paced there should always something look thats actually interesting stapled corpses get boring some point,8
1917,biggest problem i had movie were unnecessary coincidences 1 germans take every step not leave food anything behind yet there exactly 1 cow 1 milk bucket left which leads 2 town protagonist jump exactly into 1 house wherw theres also baby needs milk 3 rat just runs into trap exactly when our protagonists there course 4 plane you guessed lands exactly our heroes feet they decide help german guy why which leads blakes death,5
1917,other than movie really spectacular feast eyes but movie just few too many problems really shine me,6
1917,absolutely incredible ive seen 3 times cinemas each time i find myself even more awe blown away love film its thrilling tense gentle satisfying deeply beautiful huge fan war genre unlike any other film ive ever seen finds its true strength its unexciting human moments rather than mindless chaos firefights while still managing have some most exhilarating edgeofyourseat segments ive ever seen schofield brilliant unconventional choice lead character his empathy softness have made him one my favourite characters all time exceptionally rare example how quiet tenderness truly can carry war film better than loud banter hypermasculine bluster so often does krysty wilsoncairns genius george mackay said so much more schofields silence than most actors could hope grandest monologue masterpiece,9
1917,its experience certainly i do recommend seeing good cinema,7
1917,deakins fantastic absolutely some stunning cinematography,10
Interstellar,best movie i ever saw i watched hundreds off them godfather pulp fiction green mile pianist schindlers list rear window shining alien etc what can you ask more space exploration apocalyptic earth emotions tears time manipulation amazing visuals maybe best music score touching acting everything you want shame all oscar experts,10
Interstellar,after watching insane movie theatres back 2014 i swore god i will wait 5 years watch again so i get forget experince insanity has again without doubt best movie ever made,10
Interstellar,movie best written acted visual effected etc movie movie best movie i have ever seen i am huge christopher nolan fan movie his finest matthew mcconaughey turned his best performance his lifetime anne hathaway amazing supporting actress compared her performance les miserables i have no idea how she didnt get oscar visual effects were more than just oscar worthy they were pioneering i have never seen anything like one thing i would recommend having little previous knowledge about space not like einstein stuff though i would recommend you see movie fast you can if you nolan fan not i give movie rating 97 out 100,10
Interstellar,i judge movie how long takes me realize i need bathroom how long movie can hold my interest how convincing events unfolding well i watched movie all way through no bathroom breaks my interest grabbed start held all way through being old enough lucky enough have watched premiere 2001 space odyssey viewed several times since course i made comparisons there were few but movie tells excellent stand alone story both riveting believable im not going give away any secrets but anyone who watches last five minutes so without lump their throat tear their eye well youre critic youre not enjoying movie because youre too busy looking bloopers faults were there bloopers faults darn movie so riveting if there were any i didnt notice them,10
Interstellar,interstellar review,10
Interstellar,certain things life precious very precious so film me,10
Interstellar,why you might ask,10
Interstellar,well seldom do i get chance where i find myself sitting cinema anxious intrigued what might come time where trailers omnipresent going movies without having seen one seems unreasonable outright stupid some i had magical chance find myself front imax cold november night 2 tickets interstellar my only knowledge nolan directed mcconaughey stars,10
Interstellar,images were brilliant acting top notch everything blended together hans zimmer his music 169 minutes flew me my eyes fixed screen my heart racing there ending i couldnt believe i reliving rethinking movie while credit scenes rolled enjoying moment smell popcorn my comfortable seat what do i see next me ninety percent people cinema rushing outside after first second credit scenes,10
Interstellar,,10
Interstellar,,9
Interstellar,well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do maybe i should start watching trailers again,10
Interstellar,i have been cinema lover years read lot reviews imdb everywhere never found right movie write my first review i always thought i would wait movie,10
Interstellar,,10
Interstellar,when i first heard nolan preparing scifi movie i felt like kid again waiting his christmas gift under tree i knew would become classic im sure will,9
Interstellar,first all incredibly beautiful watch honestly so beautiful i felt like i sucked into movie way nolan decided show some scenes really remind me 2001 space odyssey actually many things will probably remind you movie we can feel talent christopher nolan just looking way filmed techniques he used contribute create visual environment believable way,10
Interstellar,sound environment just mesmerizing very important part movie because some scenes take place space noland just found right way use sound soundtrack made great hans zimmer breathtaking epic amazing unreal i could find lot more adjectives qualify but you have hear understand how epic they,10
Interstellar,these two important parts image sound create stunning atmosphere you will forget you movie theater you will lost space sucked into adventures new space odyssey begging more truly unique experience i can say i have never felt something like movie theater least not past ten years,9
Interstellar,then course cast first all matthew mcconaughey i discovered actor tropic thunder but he didnt really convince me though he quite funny then i saw dallas buyers club since movie i love him movie well he movie i exaggerate bit since there other great actors some even unexpected special guest who play extremely well but he just what needed feel human part story which very important interstellar he capable making us feel so many different emotions all along story father human anne hathaway very convincing all together actors managed create some harmony which makes human interactions credible caine chastaing affleck perfect choice then there special guest i will call him x his role which could seen minor role actually much more important than he proves once again he great actor watch see,10
Interstellar,finally scenariostory i wont spoil anything here ill just try convince you how great nolan known revolutionize everything when he tries new genre cinema well once again he did dark knight he revolutionized superhero genre interstellar hes revolutionizing scifi genre cinema what i heard he worked physicist gravitational physics astrophysics help him movie we can feel see during fifties asimov laid foundations modern science fiction lucas kubrick did same cinema today nolan laying new foundations genre cinema proving cinema still beginning what can done brace yourselves my friends we have not seen anything yet,10
Interstellar,why well simply because we only know few things about space some things cant proved moment so we can use theory make best exactly what nolan did he used theories exist today made movie about mankind about pioneers about humanity about us,10
Interstellar,because spite all scifi aspect story about humanity mcconaughey hathaway mainly x will managed convince you about,10
Interstellar,my rating movie can only 10 because itself beginning new kind cinema classic those who say we cant compare movie 2001 space odyssey nor can we compare nolan kubrick wrong we can we should talented people dont live only past some genius live today among us nolan one them many say he overrated i truly dont think so only time will answer,10
Interstellar,scifi movie decade probably best movie nolan ever made just go without second thought,10
The Godfather,godfather pinnacle flawless films first time i viewed godfather i my early teens most astounding film i had ever seen has since then stood my alltime favourite film due i have been looking forward writing review unforgettable classic so lets start beginning film opens four words i believe america its crazy think simple line has become resonant quote solely due impact made entrance films threshold just one many renowned quotes litter film believe me there lot after first take we then absorbed into life vito corleone brilliantly portrayed oscar winning performance marlon brando vito feared man he criminal he mafioso but above all he respected family man his three sons depicted three excellent actors james caan john cazale al pacino well his adopted child tom hagen played robert duvall film follows vito he attempts transfer his crime empire his reluctant son michael some most graphic gruesome death scenes have ever been seen 1970s film industry including certain horses head godfather epitomises how violence can used effectively within film corleones some greatest antiheroes have ever been seen screen whilst they villains audience will refuse accept fact coppola does something simple audacious he takes guilt out organised crime film rife beautiful cinematography memorable musical scores wellpaced action drama overall godfather one hollywoods greatest critical commercial successes gets everything right gangster flick overflowing life rich emotion subtle acting further blessed amazing direction francis ford coppola arguably most unforgettable masterpiece have ever been made,10
The Godfather,isnt just beautifully crafted gangster film outstanding family portrait matter amazing period piece character study lesson filmmaking inspiration generations actors directors screenwriters producers me more definitive film 10 stars out 10,10
The Godfather,favorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbs,10
The Godfather,lesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistls070242495,10
The Godfather,rather than concentrating everything great about godfather much easier way me judge its quality what bad about almost every film has something i dont like about but i can honestly say i wouldnt change anything about godfather there nothing weak about nothing stands out bad thats why gets ten out ten,10
The Godfather,one those films made me wonder why i hadnt seen earlier acting everyone involved great marlon brando comes across perfectly head family james caan al pacino excellent his sons soundtrack nino rota also very memorable bringing back memories film every time i hear plot has excellent get ten out ten its far predictable film definition great epic,10
The Godfather,film pretty shocking way every death occurs almost instantaneously spans ten years so many different things happen every minute great entertainment its wellmade entertaining film only first part trilogy but stands its own wonderful film its own right if you havent seen what you waiting one acclaimed film didnt disappoint,10
The Godfather,tell me movie more famous than tell me movie has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than tell me one movie has been quoted much answer you cant no movie has had much impact godfather has had ever since released,10
The Godfather,acting simply amazing what else could you say what could more appealing peopleeven today than watching actors like al pacino marlon brando james caan diane keaton talia shire robert duvall like heaven someone who fan movies movie brando able bring himself back into limelight his performance godfather alone iconic his character has been recreated so much films has almost if has not already become cliché his performance though not cliché his performance subtle breathtaking so genuine realistic not just probably but definitely more genuine than marlon brando himself al pacino perfect film well what way start up your career his character all about depth he displayed perfectly he able display his own innerbattles his mind well battles he had his family friends enemies his character more psychological character study than anything else me robert duvall me glue movie he added different perspective everything just he not italian yet having respect mafia his character man high authority within corleone family who listened insightful simply perfect giving film great balance throughout rest cast just icing cake,10
The Godfather,writing phenomenal breathtaking mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than not even quotes though makes writing here so perfect symbolism meaning went into every scene there countless symbols messages lines here so memorable yet realistic movie could get,10
The Godfather,directing coppola perfect well not many movies can 3 hours yet maintain good level interest audience like godfather coppola deserves credit symbolism messages went into every scene also has do directing not just writing movie so well edited strung together only word could come my mind perfection,10
The Godfather,cinematography music were perfect score movie one most memorable ever if you were hear you could identify right away cinematography what actually really drove movie godfather seems have mystique gives you feeling you watching something truly remarkable,9
The Godfather,horses head scene brando running his groceries coffee shop scene ill give him offer he cant refuse countless other scenes quotes movie have become part our culture these scenes lines have been recycled over over again comedies commercials etc impossible avoid greatness godfather godfather like disease once you see you fall love i dont know if greatest movie ever but definitely most iconic film ever made,10
The Godfather,one best films all time absolute masterpiece godfather arguably best gangster drama well setting standard cinema,10
The Godfather,now past 1 pm i just finished watching francis ford coppolas godfather i should probably go bed its late tomorrow i have wake up bit early but not early enough postpone writing these lines now i have seen three times opportunity sharing my thoughts refreshed insights too much good offer sit so bear me,10
The Godfather,film works so well because takes place underworld which we so embedded we do not even observe coppola puts us straight smackdab center what admittedly society made criminals criminals also reason why its so welcoming we surrounded its inhabitantscoldblooded murderers men who see crime like 9 5 job masquerading honorable men i do mean men outside we would only witness horrifying disturbing manifestations their wellthought out actions,10
The Godfather,but goes even deeper than all revolves around corleone family led don vito corleone marlon brando he most honest these men sitting right edge but people like him who do not fully embrace world its not easy he avoids conflict until absolutely necessary he man defined moral principles there scene beginning which during his daughters wedding day one his associates luca brasi lenny montana practices his speech he going give don when he meets him scene these two funny almost adorable i could not help but sympathize both them only realize i am feeling warmth two mobsters not even mention lenny montana actual mob hitman he actually nervous he said line,10
The Godfather,more i watched more i realized just how incredibly complex ruthless society how has power corrupt anyone come contact best example corleones youngest son michael al pacino he returns home his sisters wedding war hero dressed part his longtime girlfriend kay adams diane keaton first he avoids underworld but necessity firsthand exposure just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him we get further film change shocking every outsider who ever got close him tainted one way another if they survive they drawn well we viewers,10
The Godfather,inside coppola exposes family us fully bold personal approach we witness every discussion every methodically calculated choice crime done simply because nature their business we put chair alongside them so we easily relate us they good guys rival families bad guys greatest feat film managed pull offset apart good guys bad guys world filled bad guys,10
The Godfather,film unmatched subtlety no other movie sustains itself good no other film done such precision attention completeness there many layers which i probably missed maybe will never notice but i felt them what director francis ford coppola his partner crime poor choice words sorry mario puzo did nothing short timeless piece reference cinema whose influence not based reinventing wheel but rather perfecting absolute maximum,10
The Godfather,most masterpieces remembered their historical contributions citizen kane brought biggest stepup art form same things did gone wind 2001 space odyssey godfather one few films will remembered simply because they good i cannot possibly imagine greater achievement,10
The Godfather,godfather one few films which i personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings direction acting storyline score godfather has word classic written all over really not much surprise now considered many one top five movies all time perhaps when comes cinematic techniques godfather has not been revolutionary citizen kane but its influence motion pictures comparable rarely movie has defined redefined genre much one did gangster movies but its influence goes well beyond,8
The Godfather,godfathers influence has been so big through years elements can found virtually every organized crime film nowadays almost every comedy featuring gangster last few years has spoofed something godfather italianamerican old mobster ala don vito corleone has become one most established figures publics imagination,9
The Godfather,but say godfather simply influential diminish its true qualities so describe simply movie about gangsters mafia certainly main focus story revolves around despite fact word never mentioned but although movie never tries forcedly insert separate subjects contains amount psychological social subtexts cannot overlooked considerations how social environments changes us how moral values appear different different point views how violence can destroy human soul how power can corrupt individual deeply blended into story stays practically always true complete realism result picture astonishing efficacy believability,10
Ford v Ferrari,what cinema supposed amazing chemistry acting both leads seamless cgi practical effects enhance film firecracker script true story pulse pounding soundtrack booming sound mix edited so well 25 hours flies completely utterly engaging so good fact i saw twice within 24 hours once imax once dolby cinema,10

Ford v Ferrari,ive seen lot car movies selfprofessed car nut such i judge them harshly immediately dismiss entries dont provide enough reason care about what more important than car driver think fast furious transformers franchise if you care about driver driver cares about car you care about car car tool extension heros body gains provenance audience when helps hero their personal journey movies come mind do effectively include gone 60 seconds bullitt need speed italian job batman begins bourne identity some james bond movies do well like goldfinger spy who loves me living daylights skyfall but many do not because lack character arc story we cannot forget about perhaps greatest car movie all time back future shining example how make car proper star,8
Ford v Ferrari,now enters film james mangold starring talented actors matt damon christian bale called ford v ferrari my arms crossed expectations lowered i ready disappointed although i love mangold director somehow i assumed there would michael bay approach movie putting more emphasis car action sequences than characters my surprise not only i dead wrong but film became one best car movies i had ever seen,10
Ford v Ferrari,thinking back i should have known better unlike many car action oriented movies one based true story factbased dramas tend take themselves more seriously sort shared biopic between legendary sports car designer carroll shelby race car driver ken miles movie focuses their efforts beat ferrari le mans story im well aware like i said bonafide car nut mangold oscar winning filmmaker collaborating oscar winning people such damon bale,10
Ford v Ferrari,boy do their talents shine movie driving engine story if you will loving but times clashing relationship between shelby miles portrayed brilliantly damon bale manner my opinion more entertaining engaging than dynamic duo dicaprio pitt once upon time hollywood damon bale have different styles acting but both arrive same place creating character faces disappointment search victory,8
Ford v Ferrari,shelby has come terms disappointment having quit his racing career due heart problems creating winning team le mans his way proving himself hes still winner miles desperate not disappoint himself because unlike shelby hes never had shot winning big race due his abrasive personality despite amazing talent race track top miles desperately doesnt want disappoint his wife son who support him fervently his dream both characters have their own obstacles search escaping disappointment shelby dealing suits ford miles dealing problems car race they present themselves trial besting other race car drivers their individual struggles intersect mutual desire win le mans resulting brotherhood mutual love each other feels genuine earned,9
Ford v Ferrari,henry ford ii played very effective tracy letts reveals quick but moving scene why he wants win le mans after shelby takes ford whirlwind nauseating ride new race car they have engineered ford breaks into tears not so much because physically jarring experience being jostled around breakneck speed but because what car means his family name i had no idea if only my dad were alive see he tells shelby damon scene responds wet eyes character ford reveals how much he doesnt want disappoint his family legacy fact entire endeavor started insult ferrari stating youre only henry ford second youll never henry ford earlier scene ford compares himself his legendary grandfather speech ford factory workers concerning his disappointment current company sales,9
Ford v Ferrari,cars represent mans desire chase dream whether designing fastest car driving cars fastest despite all obstacles may get mans way biggest one always himself but perseverance help others obstacle can too overcome ford v ferrari manages get heart message deceptive ease supreme confidence films absolutely gorgeous cinematography direction capture some most amazing car sequences ever put big screen surprising but believable behind scenes factoid mangold cast not car nuts all were simply moved tell story characters why movie works so well because they understood car supporting story rather than other way around,9
Ford v Ferrari,ford v ferrari absolute winner memorable performances its cast my favorite mangold picture thus far me one best year far car movies go one best ever made miles away disappointment,8
Ford v Ferrari,rating 1010 inspired movie year wonderfully made good story well told tightly written well acted directed i hope matt damon christian bale can winning oscar awards because he already deliver character very well thank you all you because make movie so amazing masterpiece,9
Ford v Ferrari,just saw f v f telluride film festival phenomenal perfect performances incredible visuals editing immersive sound riveting story real winner christian bale lost 70 pounds defoe role delight damon spot catriona balfe excellent all actors playing ford executives excellent well masterful direction james mangold must see,9
Ford v Ferrari,start off i have always hated racing yes hated think its ridiculous waste resources boring watch i have zero interest cars thus i know absolutely nothing history i knew nothing film beyond reading blurb before i started watching so i very interested see whether i would like all i did despite being so uninterested subject film got me interested story especially during final race i edge seat not knowing what would happen fantastic acting job both damon bale usual they never disappoint excellent writing directing cutting sound editing very whole package overall,8
Ford v Ferrari,finish off i am still not interested cars racing but film stands its own even so,10
Ford v Ferrari,ford v ferrari one best movies ive seen year someone who has little interest cars besides minivans suvs thats saying lot just like race cars produced its namesakes ford v ferrari sleek fast powerful expensive machine supremely wellbalanced combination corporate rivalry ontrack competitiveness human drama,8
Ford v Ferrari,lot notes were hit ford v ferrari characters fleshed out very well give you emotional attachment youre looking movie bale damons performances great they pull you into story completely disappear into their roles james mangold proves once again master behind camera action scenes shot perfection will have you biting your nails,10
Ford v Ferrari,films technical aspects were topnotch well wait film nominated sound design editing these technical aspects during climax film will blow your hair back give you goosebumps,10
Ford v Ferrari,all all film provides pleasing experience crowd not many films can even come close delivering i loved about every second despite its long runtime,9
Ford v Ferrari,biopics can hard sell times whether youre diving into troubled life addict exploring someones sexuality there many touchy subjects these days said i feel there also those will stand test time terms being able please wide audience ford v ferrari one latest true stories out hollywood will hitting big screen soon heres why i believe absolutely deserves attention,8
Ford v Ferrari,following multiple characters throughout ford v ferrari focussed fact henry ford ii given idea create fastest race car world his mission take down likes company ferrari who have held title years carol shelby matt damon approached member ford team recruited only one finding himself recruiting driver ken miles christian bale thats core premise theres lot dive into there,10
Ford v Ferrari,if youre fan racing cars general movie will you very welldirected film james mangold racing sequences quite long taking up good chunk nearly 150minute run time luckily they very intense practically shot fantastic score back up sound effects get your heart pumping everything about exciting aspects film top notch,10
Ford v Ferrari,christian bale matt damon give stellar performances here two leading men film i totally bought their rigid friendship slowly developed sadly without giving anything away there incident i feel not explored enough which slightly took away when certain moment meant impact movie other than fantastic movie beginning end,10
Ford v Ferrari,end ford v ferrari engaging emotional downright thrilling when wants i invested these characters edge my seat during climactic races i thoroughly enjoyed my experience movie there missed opportunity terms emotion during certain scene but i able forgive seeing rest movie so impressive ford v ferrari one best movies ive seen so far year will one see when officially releases,9
Ford v Ferrari,jesus christ bale does again,9
Ford v Ferrari,great script great casting incredible acting everyone but especially bale,10
The Invisible Man,i really enjoyed first 23 film they filled palpable tension general unease not being able see monster another example how what you cannot see often scarier than what you can see direction great perfectly places viewer elizabeth moss shoes which what generates most tension you viewer also unsure where invisible person all times spin domestic violence also lends new modern twist classic premise,7
The Invisible Man,where film falters its third act some significant plot holes regarding cameras visibility certain actions there were also several times where film felt like its conclusion but kept going ending will likely divisive however i didnt hate invisible man technically very wellmade thriller but loses few marks due some issues plot,4
The Invisible Man,hg wellss original invisible man 1897 suggests rather than something powerful invisibility being used betterment mankind would instead used fulfil private desires ultimately leading moral corruption otherwise good men probably best cinematic adaptation,4
The Invisible Man,taken much further suggestion results invisibility would nothing less than sexual violence evil madness however despite centrality theme core story reframing template tale domestic abuse ptsd happens latest adaptation which focuses not male scientist but female victim his fascinating idea creating potential some timely metoo social commentary particularly relates issues not believing women who accuse powerful men gaslighting but potential only gets you so far what could have been really insightful film eventually proves itself relatively incapable using issues domestic abuse anything other than plot points get one predictable scare next,3
The Invisible Man,film begins cecilia kass,1
The Invisible Man,putting into motion plan leave her domineering abusive boyfriend adrian griffin,7
The Invisible Man,wealthy pioneer optics having drugged him she leaves their hightech home middle night picked up nearby her sister emily,1
The Invisible Man,who takes her stay their childhood friend james lanier,4
The Invisible Man,policeman living his daughter sydney,1
The Invisible Man,although assured adrian cant find her cecilia clearly suffering agoraphobia paranoia until adrian commits suicide contacted his brother tom,9
The Invisible Man,whos handling his estate cecilia learns adrian has left her 5 million however despite her best efforts move she just cant shake feeling adrian still around watching her sometimes even same room her surer she becomes hes not dead more everyone else becomes worried about her mental wellbeing,8
The Invisible Man,written directed,5
The Invisible Man,latest adaptation wellss original not actually about invisible man indeed short background shot him lying bed shot showing only his torso he runs through forest closeup his hand actor oliver jacksoncohen doesnt even appear screen prior his apparent suicide adrian not only invisible man plot so too his character ideologically invisible which makes its own statement its statement worth making men like him dont need present continue cause harm sense least initially film more concerned fear adrian has instilled cecilia early stages cecilias main enemy isnt adrian so much her inability move him along same lines film looks issues how women who accuse powerful men gaslighting often ignored openly disbelieved,1
The Invisible Man,aesthetically film looks terrific particularly,2
The Invisible Man,s cinematography into which built cecilias paranoia example countless scenes involve camera panning away her moving across room showing us nothing all then panning back ordinarily would textbook unmotivated camera movement but here conveys how cecelia fears there may something corner which we panned now thanks camera pan so do we there also many shots which another film would awful framing isolating cecilia frame filling up so much screens realestate empty negative space except again film such negative space has ominousness not applicable regular thrillers way whannell can instil fear dread simply pointing camera empty room without need any fx vfx makeup elaborate props etc which no doubt played significant role keeping budget down minuscule 7 million id remiss if i didnt mention mosss performance which excellent especially given so much her her own reacting nothing whatsoever having communicate confusion fear anger etc through little more than her expression,9
The Invisible Man,before talking about why i didnt like film however i want reiterate i honestly cant say how much i admire idea reconstitute genre template story about domestic violence its especially timely reconstitution coming does era metoo when so many powerful men once considered invisible everything but name able perpetrate their crimes impunity have been revealed monsters they so i have no problem ideological paradigm shift my problem execution,1
The Invisible Man,one thing we know getgo cecilia isnt imagining things adrian faked his suicide now stalking her whilst invisible isnt twist film makes no attempt hide granted kind unavoidable given how wellknown property but had film allowed even little bit ambiguity could have done wonders emotional complexity turning story about invisibility into story possibly about mental collapse would have effectively placed audience same position other characters doubting cecilias state mind which would turn have enhanced potency sociopolitical allegory another thing bothered me film so focused surveillance privacy there several scenes where if there even one functioning cctv camera movie ends pivotal scene restaurant especially egregious example one grainy image camera cecilia can prove shes not going nuts whole plot unravels,1
The Invisible Man,however my biggest problem what starts fascinating study lasting ramifications domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity ridiculously overthetop final act says nothing interest about anything true hollow man has pretty overthetop final act too but hollow man never saw itself anything other than schlocky genre affair whereas invisible man clearly does fact whannell ultimately undermines himself way deploying such important themes merely get him gory dénouement especially frustrating insofar he genuinely did originally seem have some interesting things say tied adrian introduced such abhorrent character start void nuance subtlety domestic abusers arent monotone evildoers oftentimes theyre very charming surface any film claiming serious examination topic would make room address,1
The Invisible Man,although invisible man very well reviewed huge boxoffice hit left me disappointed frustrated initially positioning itself insightful allegory difficulty victims domestic abuse have moving their lives even after abuser gone eventually privileges genre beats cheap thrills over emotional complexity which huge shame massively missed opportunity,1
The Invisible Man,when you first watch movie youre thinking okay pretty good interesting starts slow but builds up ending nice she gets away killing abusive ex boyfriend lives happily ever after,1
The Invisible Man,but after thinking about things minute you realize other than her saying you dont see any real indication he did much her you pretty much taking her word everything then when comes boyfriend what about him you see yeah he can manipulative but you barely see but then you see main thing movie about invisible suit what they really made who were they made how many those suits did he really have,3
The Invisible Man,then top when youre learning about boyfriend you learn he supposed top everything very observant knows what going his place especially when comes those suits he would know how many he has whats going them yet when she hides one those suits doesnt register his mind like she took suit off dummy didnt replace dummy place fact attacked moments later so shouldve been known suit missing would closet somewhere leading towards closet since where she went yet nothing,1
The Invisible Man,then there scene where her sister gets her throat cut middle fancy restaurant thing about any eating establishment there cameras everywhere fancier more cameras there would so how they were so sure she killed her sister didnt spend single second looking any video footage because if they would have spent any time they would have seen floating knife notice something isnt right but nope somehow all ignored she just immediately guilty,6
The Invisible Man,there when daughter got hit while main girl down ground like shes starting get back up her feet little distance away daughter gets hit doesnt register there no way she could have hit me something had have hit me nope like if youre your hands knees there no way youre generating enough force knock someone ground didnt register girl,7
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,scott pilgrim vs world probably close well come having experimental film released theaters nationwide one most innovative original movies come out years its unlike anything id seen before yes good very good i could not stop laughing whole time,9
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,onto plot scott something loser hes socially awkward he shares mattress bunkerlike apartment toronto sarcastic gossip king hes band called sex bobombs but theyre really not great he also has clinging hyperactive girlfriend knives whos only 17 kind big deal when hes 22 all changes when he dreams purple haired girl roller blades very next day he finds out shes real her name ramona flowers shes cool new girl town his first attempt hook up fails miserably his second attempt although even more lamed brained actually works theyre soon item but now comes bad news win her love scott must defeat her seven evil exs he also has evil ex his own plus theres matter breaking up knives battle bands coming up,8

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,movies humor comes not only sheer ridiculousness situations but also characters reactions them after one exs has flown through brick wall battled scott middle concert everyone just kind weirded out they dont act like nothing has happened which would make hard audience suspend their disbelief nor do they run screaming police which would only complicate matters,9
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,comedic effect also generated through use deadpan dialog instance when knives confesses shes never kissed boy before scott replies straight face its okay neither have i bands selfintroduction were sex bobombs were here make you all sad depressed stuff,10
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,movie also pokes gentle fun hipster subculture way ramona has thirty plus flavors tea how scotts roommate always texting there also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out much scotts amazement scene when intro seinfeld plays after characters enter apartment canned laughter follows every line,8
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,editing structure highly nontraditional heavy use dreams daydreams montages animated flashbacks asides chapter titles introducing segments visuals impressive very imaginative such way flashes color accompany playing any musical instrument allowing you see sound speaking which sound another high point not only energetic rock fueled sound track but also sound effects taken classic games like mario zelda,8
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,scott pilgrim vs world succeeds telling offbeat story providing interesting characters producing lots laughs other than couple tooobvious puns i honestly cant think anything wrong movie i would highly recommend anyone their teens twenties four stars,8

Harriet,i attend hbcu have read studied harriet tubmans life i dont even know where begin there no account her ever standing union soldiers pointing gun there so many errors what i saw screen complete fiction i wasnt expecting documentary course but woman they portrayed lived completely different life everything ive been taught professors who live breathe african american history hollywood should ashamed,4
Harriet,look nobodys questioning harriet tubmans contributions her role history abolitionist movement but except names movie has about much do actual history underdog does rescuing war dogs i have wonder what would have happened black woman walking around slave holding south dressed like hollywoods version pseudo annie oakley filmmakers had golden opportunity here get right but chose throw bunch candified hollywood cliches instead thats not say there werent some emotional moments but real history achievement harriet tubman emotional soul stirring enough without burying under 10 feet hollywood glitz order appeal superhero crowd boo hiss,1
Harriet,why how difficult get first hand historical accounts stick script what earth gained taking larger than life figure real person throwing random people events never happened,1
Harriet,if you want see real movie harriet tubman look cicely tyson version woman called moses,1
Harriet,i wonder if people giving film nine ten star review rating even saw film we rating film not person if there botched problem ridden film da vinci we dont rate bad film highly because we like person who putative its subject,3
Harriet,please scripting insultingly lowbrow almost patronizing acting talent has good record other productions but film unrealized due other problems there quite few ahistoric frankly false events film which not needed make film more less than credible hagiography opposed plenty sufficient bravery courage strength tubman herself why maker her some kind mythical comic book type character story about real life hero about graphic novel superwoman who people will just assume fictional,5
Harriet,lastly i am not religious believer i am confirmed atheist but i find troubling tubmans deep religious feelings expression whihc she used main if not sole lens though which she saw world which motivated her discounted,1
Harriet,film not total loss but tubman deserves better much better do contemporary audiences,1
Harriet,has biggest disappointment 2019 whenever movie made about historical figures theres always some degree fiction however they went above beyond degree ridiculous they needlessly created primary characters arent part historical record also some elements relationship between harriet tubman slave master were totally unbelievablethe acting ok but never reached caliber one would expect type film finally cinematography wasnt great done way made seem like lifetime movie something should have gone straight dvd instead being theaters,10
Harriet,its bit insult african americans being story wasnt depicted clearly way shouldve although harriet hero played super hero movie took greatness turned into joke cynthias performance corny well others,5
Harriet,movie could have been steeped actual history about incredible woman they created storyline complete rubbish fiction denied viewers insight into some most amazing things about women what shame i think people loved movie simply dont really know their history primary antagonist made up person drive fictional storyline,8
Harriet,putting aside directing editing overall story line films most egregious aspect may actually score think cheesy lifetime tv movie style music so terrible fact actually distracting might actually only silver lining considering sluggish pace film also unfortunately only tells one part harriet tubmans incredible life unfortunate has taken hollywood long make film about tubman however perhaps they should have waited little longer get right,2
Harriet,so harriet actual person but story cooked up falseso tired them mixing little truth lot lies,9
Harriet,terribly inaccurate revisionist story which tries make light slavery once again makes black man bad guy if you want truth not you shameful,10
Harriet,im not understanding why so many people hating movie show me movie based life real person where entire movie 100 factual i thought did depict what i have read about harriet tubman books online what i actually read when i visited harriet tubman museumsvisitor center church creek md cambridge md not poorly done i loved highly recommend,1
Harriet,i went wanting love ended up just waiting over best part me closing scene written adlibs after i really dont like disparaging works show history blacks america our stories need told but i very disappointed lead did not evoke any compassion me villain very unconvincing think about 12 years slave django had you sideeyeing actors played slave owners because they emoted so well lead villain gideon brodess god bless him didnt pull off imo fact best performances were supporting cast leslie odom william still clarke peter harriets father omar j dorsey no spoilers role henry hunter hall no spoilers role doesnt bode well film maybe fact they made harriet 24 25 instead mature woman maybe dialogue written bit slick time period maybe inconsistencies what presented vs reality even janelle monae just so so me although i do not work hollywood when there many failures within performances only veteran actors shine may director i dunno but i disappointed i would still support film because we need hollywood know we want our stories heardseen maybe if viola davis project had gotten support her version would have been better she going star produce biopic harriet tubman hbo but never happened i would give 510 stars,8
Harriet,harriet 2019,2
Harriet,abolitionist harriet tubman escaped maryland philadelphia 1849 foot following north star utilizing help underground railroad network secret routes safe houses set up white abolitionists free people color help slaves freedom she then repeatedly risked her life going back into lions den over period eleven years lead other slaves their freedom she never lost passenger so damn brave makes my head spin,9
Harriet,film served up substantantial serving history embellished modicum fiction though its not movie masterpiece its strong depiction harriets heroes journey lifted me up days cynthia erivos portrayal determined harriet known before her liberation araminta minty ross later nicknamed moses because she helped her people escape freedom stirring her singing gold edges harriet used spirituals coded messages warn fellows danger signal clear path,1
Harriet,antagonist story racist corrupt system slavery embodied part her heartless owners plagued hypersomnia sleeping spells caused head injury when she thirteen mintys owner edward bodess tried sell her would separate her her family there were no buyers her angry minty prayed oh lord if you aint never going change mans heart kill him lord take him out way edward died harriet expressed regret prayer,8
Harriet,joe alwyn played gideon brodess edwards grown son conniving lecherous sneer guideon leered after minty tormented her harriets husband free black man theory but not reality any future children couple would slaves regardless papers granting manumet harriets kin which brodesses ignored she her husband planned escape together but tubman fled alone travelled hundred miles through wilderness pennsylvania being followed her scummy owner gildeon well screw him she made became heroine,7
Harriet,who movie really made possibly didnt want certain peoplegroup offended subject matter actress filmmakers claimed not slave movie if harriet not slave movie then what slave harriet running away harriet tubmans story dramatic enough without adding fictional unreal characters if harriet tubman has told then please tell her story way happened harriet had lifetime movie feel actress cynthia eviro didnt feel authentic me role harriet tubman oh well i had free movie ticket so,1
Harriet,i have seen film twice first time middleburg film festival where director spoke afterwards what unique about movie its honesty its focus i cannot relate bad reviews all not cartoon does not depict harriet superhero she suffered greatly but film focuses empowerment harriet largely through her own bravery rather than making her one dimensional victim she hero because she took risks made choices other characters did not she felt god working through her show slavery system could beaten but slaveholders cited god too so you see both sides,10
Hamilton,i mean i pretty high but still,10
Hamilton,definitely lived up my hype,10
Hamilton,although many musical adaptations have flopped may have proved best way do simply film play what you get one best musicals available watch whenever you like affordable price great work everyone involved especially lin manuel miranda,10
Hamilton,just time fourth july disney doing solid anyone who couldnt get ticket broadway sensation known hamilton all 160 minutes including very brief intermission some minor censoring language will streaming service starting july 3rd shot over two nights 2016 most original cast including all its tony winners more than just filmed performance great care has gone into making cinematic possible camerawork editing direction also bring one thing you couldnt get richard rogers theatre closeness allows you see emotions sweat performers faces director thomas kail who also helmed stage production uses his closeups judiciously but manages keep level intimacy even when were able see entire stage all its performers,10
Hamilton,its pg13 rating most adult movie appear behind walt disney castle logo its certainly raunchy ways uncle walt wouldnt have approved most notably depicting adulterous events led reynolds pamphlet sidney sheldonworthy tellall published its protagonist alexander hamilton linmanuel miranda well he never gonna president now sings thomas jefferson tony winner daveed diggs conceit seems particularly quaint hilarious when you consider who elected office year hamilton won 11 tonys pulitzer prize,10
Hamilton,fact timing release continues put musical conversation current events specifically recent spate stories people color being delegitimized completely left out boardrooms writers rooms other places where decisions were made when aaron burr tony winner leslie odom jr sings about wanting room where happens lyrics accompanied deliberately loaded image black man singing them hamiltons casting mostly black latinx asian performers portray reallife people we knew were white lest we forget slaveowners questionable only if one doesnt consider major theme mirandas book not only who gets tell american story but also subjects themselves dont really have any control over storyteller past few weeks filled white voiceover artists voluntarily stepping aside let black artists voice their black characters im sure casting conceit will litigated once again whataboutism court public opinion,9
Hamilton,but i digress,10
Hamilton,since hamilton soundtrack has been charts since its release lot viewers will finally have visual context lyrics they know heart starting opening number alexander hamilton miranda crams ungodly amount exposition history into his lyrics often using rap means his end odoms burr selfproclaimed damn fool shot hamilton cast detail early years our hero tracing him caribbean new york city its our first look paul tazewells costume design howell binkleys lighting both which will showcased cinematographer declan quinn kails superb framing were also introduced main actors voices each distinct wonderful their own right opening other detailfilled songs millennials what schoolhouse rock my generation though abc would have found too dangerous spring us kids,10
Hamilton,greatness mirandas songs lies diversity their musical styles choices he makes each number since almost every word musical sung its lot fun discovering what combination rap rb gospel power ballad hell employ he gives one truly oldschool broadway show tune catchy yet terrifying youll back king george iii deliciously snarky jonathan groff if symbolizing difference between old country scruffy colonists who rebelling against miranda effortlessly changes gears when he wants reach larger emotional moments resonate all way back theater most notably songs schuyler sisters angelica tony winner renée elise goldsberry who pines hamilton eliza phillipa soo who marries him,9
Hamilton,again intimacy kails camera works wonders here emotions actors faces they sing so lovingly embraced especially when theyre pouring out their hearts he captures paternal love burrs eyes when he sings daughter he hopes live long enough see grow old were close enough see elizas mind working she wonders if she can compete her husbands ambitions not throwing away his shot angelica practically vibrates love protection her younger sister every beautiful smirk diggs face captured whether hes lafayette first act thomas jefferson second latter diggs wears purple outfit looks lifted one princes paisley park walkin closets,8
Hamilton,hamilton miranda excellent giving himself line about immigrants thats bound stick craw some people hes carefully calibrated colead spectacular odom burr wins duel here but miranda shows mvp its creative genius one place where hamilton falters slightlyand i had problem broadway wellis its depiction george washington christopher jackson wonderful role my god man can sing but while everyone else gets dinged enough balance their legends their humanity washington kind gets pass hes seen reverentially which works quite well jacksons largerthanlife portrayal but whereas everyone else breaks free bland lessons i got history class washington feels like hes still trapped my textbook,9
Hamilton,viewer always aware live production filmed enthusiastic audience theres applause after every number wide shots capture turntable portions set we can occasionally see audience orchestra pit adds welcome you there feeling proceedings its said live theater like catching lightning bottle every night different can never repeated its nice have bit lightning your disposal courtesy movie,9
Hamilton,even nicer how representation provided actors color forces viewer consider what might have happened if people who looked like performers were actually allowed take part crafting american ideals laws thenburgeoning nation our ancestors built country their descendants still begging equality still fighting room where happens no matter how entertaining iteration hamilton isand its massively entertainingthese ideas always lurking nearby demanding consideration,9
Hamilton,ive been lucky enough catch show tour minneapolis amazing another reviewer said how all broadway productions should released not all hollywood stylized but live filmed production original cast before audience about close perfection you can get,9
Hamilton,im mexican boy who has never got chance go broadway all ive seen bootlegs theyre fine but not like beautiful shot great spectacle hamilton flawless music lin manuel miranda production photography costumes acting leslie odom jr renneè miranda daveed diggs shine their roles i dont know can nominated any award but damn deserves,10
Hamilton,fantastic musical so amazingly done characters singing fantastic auto tune has taken over music department but not these their real voices 1010,9

The Shawshank Redemption,shawshank redemption written directed frank darabont adaptation stephen king novella rita hayworth shawshank redemption starring tim robbins morgan freeman film portrays story andy dufresne robbins banker who sentenced two life sentences shawshank state prison apparently murdering his wife her lover andy finds tough going but finds solace friendship he forms fellow inmate ellis red redding freeman while things start pick up when warden finds andy prison job more befitting his talents banker however arrival another inmate going vastly change things all them,10
The Shawshank Redemption,there no fanfare bunting put out release film back 94 title didnt give much inkling anyone about what about columbia pictures unsure how market shawshank redemption barely registered box office however come academy award time film received several nominations although won none stirred up interest film its home entertainment release rest they say history film finally found audience saw film propelled almost mythical proportions endearing modern day classic something has delighted its fans whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors one thing sure though which ever side shawshank fence you sit film continues gather new fans simply will never go away loose mythical status,10
The Shawshank Redemption,its possibly simplicity all sends some haters film into cinematic spasms implausible plot apparent sentimental edge makes nonsense prison life but two chief complaints those dislike film passion yet when characters richly drawn so movingly performed strikes me churlish do down human drama thats dealing hope friendship faith sentimental aspect indeed there but acts counterpoint suffering degradation shattering soul involving our protagonist cosy prison life you say no chance need human connection never more needed than during incarceration surely given quite terrific performances robbins never better freeman sublimely making easy its easiest thing world warm andy red,10
The Shawshank Redemption,those support arent faring too bad either bob gunton coiled spring smarm warden norton james whitmore heart achingly great birdman shawshank clancy brown menacing antagonist capt byron hadley william sadler amusing heywood mark rolston impressively vile bogs diamond then theres roger deakins lush cinematography camera gracefully glides out prison offering almost ethereal hope our characters yes they ours music pings conjunction emotional flow movie too thomas newmans score mostly piano based dovetailing neatly andys state mind while excellently selected soundtrack ranges likes hank williams gorgeous le nozze di figaro mozart,10
The Shawshank Redemption,if you love shawshank then its love lasts lifetime every viewing brings same array emotions anger revilement happiness sadness inspiration warmth can reduce most hardened into misty eyed wonderment above all else though shawshank offers hope not just characters movie but better life better world all us 1010,10
The Shawshank Redemption,why do i want write 234th comment shawshank redemption i am not sure almost everything could possibly said about has been said but like so many other people who wrote comments i am profoundly moved simple eloquent depiction hope friendship redemption,10
The Shawshank Redemption,only other movie i have ever seen effects me strongly kill mockingbird both movies leave me feeling cleaner having watched them,10
The Shawshank Redemption,i didnt intend see movie all i do not like prison movies i dont normally watch them i work branch library one day i checking shawshank redemption out one our older patrons she said me whenever i feel down depressed i check out movie watch always makes me feel better time i thought very strange one day there nothing tv except things i absolutely would not watch under any circumstance things i had seen too many times already i remembered what she said so i watched i have watched many many times since then gets better every showing,10
The Shawshank Redemption,no action no special effects just men prison uniforms talking each other,10
The Shawshank Redemption,shawshank redemption kill mockingbird best movies i have ever seen i do not judge its technical merits i dont really care about i have read citizen kane godfather movie best movie ever made they may have best technique most influential motion pictures ever made but not best best movies ones touch soul takes movie like shawshank redemption touch soul,10
The Shawshank Redemption,its oscar year shawshank redemption written directed frank darabont after novella rita hayworth shawshank redemption stephen king nominated seven academy awards walked away zero best picture went forrest gump while shawshank pulp fiction were just happy nominated course hindsight 2020 but while history looks back gump good film pulp redemption remembered some alltime best pulp however success word go making huge splash cannes making its writerdirector american master after only two films andy dufresne co success didnt come easy fortunately failure wasnt life sentence,10
The Shawshank Redemption,after opening 33 screens take 727327 25m film fell fast theatres finished mere 283m reasons failure many firstly title clunker while iconic fans today 1994 people knew not cared not what shawshank dvd tim robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him rickshaw movie marketingwise films nightmare prison drama tough sell women story love between two best friends doesnt spell winner men worst all movie slow molasses desson thomson writes washington post wanders down subplots every opportunity ignores abundance narrative exit points before settling its finale but these same weaknesses make film so strong,10
The Shawshank Redemption,firstly its setting opening aerial shots prison total eyeopener amazing piece architecture strong gothic design immediately prison becomes character casts its shadow over most film its tall stone walls stretching above every shot towers over men contains blotting out all memories outside world only andy robbins holds onto hope its music its sandy beaches zihuatanejo heres where you need most he says you need so you dont forget forget there places world arent made out stone theres theres theres something inside thats yours they cant touch red morgan freeman doesnt think much andy first picking tall glass o milk silver spoon up his ass first new fish crack andy says not word losing his bet red resents him but over time two get know each other they quickly become best friends again one films major strengths many movies about love many flicks have sidekick hero but shawshank only one i can think looks honestly love between two best friends seems odd hollywood would skip relationship time again when its feeling weighs so much into everyones day day lives perhaps its too sentimental seem conventional but shawshanks core friendship hits all right notes film much better,10
The Shawshank Redemption,its pacing deliberate well we spend film watching same actors easy forget movies timeline spans well over 20 years such huge measure time would pass slowly reality would only amplified prison its not if film lacks interest these moments still knows where its going merely intends taking its sweet time getting there pays off well tedium prison life makes climax much more exhilarating anyone who sees moment never forgotten,10
The Shawshank Redemption,themes faith hope there definite religious subtext found here quiet selfless carefree andy obvious christ figure warden norton bob gunton obviously modeled richard nixon who his day close personified satan they come but if you arent looking subtexts movie speaks anyone search hope compelling drama very moving film perfectly written acted shot they just dont come much better than,8
The Shawshank Redemption,overall score 9810 shawshank redemption served message hope hollywood well more than any film memory proved there life after box office besting forrest fiction ran solely strong word mouth became hottest rented film 1995 currently sits 2 imdbs top 250 films occasionally swapping spots godfather top ranked film all time redemption indeed if you havent seen yet what hell you waiting andy says comes down simple choice really either get busy living get busy dying,10
The Shawshank Redemption,im trying save you money last film title you should consider borrowing renting shawshank will cost you five bucks just plunk down 25 own title youll wind up going back gem time time again one few movies truly timeless its entertaining moving no matter how many times you view,10
The Shawshank Redemption,forget about what others including myself might suggest youll discover shawshank redemption when you watch youll identify something very personal your own life scene character moment uncomplicated movie when you need hope youll look shawshank when you want believe will overcoming even greatest obstacles shawshank will uplift you ways you cant find movies today,10
The Shawshank Redemption,some liken film some kind spiritual awakening course some can go church mosque find enlightenment faith humanity but most places worship open only certain days times but when you need affirmation lasting bond friendships prevail over most dire circumstances shawshank will give you makes grown men like me cry still i wonder whether shawshank truly meant viewing privacy home because personal experience really makes you look inward nominated seven best film never one single oscar,10
The Shawshank Redemption,how ironic innocent man winds up being surrounded corruption legal system shawshank itself similar character andy dufresne prejudging classic film critics couldnt get past title public followed suit initially dismissing shawshank which failed box office just like its wonderful life citizen kane could have just whithered away store shelves like andy dufresne could have his own cell but characters prevailed because andy shawshank stayed true now these movies right up there most popular films all time,10
The Shawshank Redemption,anyone who has yet watch shawshank may so jaded movies films title how 212 hour movie set inside walls prison can manage tap soul such wide range people shawshank has not one explosion i wonder if even has single special effect digitally enhanced frame,10
The Shawshank Redemption,but every aspect shawshank fit together acting top bit part musical score editing photography story opening credits final scene all involved including town mansfield ohio where shawshank actually filmed played their roles perfectly shawshank must see must own title,10
The Shawshank Redemption,i have never seen such amazing film since i saw shawshank redemption shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes dreams what so great about movie moves you gives you hope even though circumstances between characters viewers quite different you dont feel far removed what characters going through,9
Ad Astra,i generally like slow burn psychological dramas which movie supposed holy mother god bad movie they try get you emotionally involved fatherson drama but have one preposterous plot line after another,1
Ad Astra,order get mars you have fly light side moon then drive car dark side moon where you attacked moon pirates moon pirates,4
Ad Astra,way mars you stop answer distress call kind like stopping help someone flat tire course you easily enter distressed ship outside when you enter you attacked rabid rafiki lion king,2
Ad Astra,once mars you able sneak into rocket neptune even though you were standing ground under rocket engines when count down 10 some reason you had swim underwater space suit quite ways get rocket,2
Ad Astra,when you get neptune you park your rocket i mean park opposite side rings so you have go through rings way down loony pops come back through rings makeshift shield you removed outside spacecraft no tools while wearing spacesuit,1
Ad Astra,get back home neptune earth you propelled whole way nuclear bomb you used destroy loony pops ship ship way somehow destroying known universe,2
Ad Astra,moral all we may alone universe so we should all love each other,1
Ad Astra,end,2
Ad Astra,saw reviews really excited but dreadful story just doesnt make sense obviously radio waves just dont exist universe if they did story wouldnt have been necessary guy needs travel all way mars send voice message neptune couldnt have been sent mars brad pitt needed sound proof room record message hes able board rocket launches obviously g forces dont exist either newtons laws motion matter when set they had better luna buggys 1970s wave capable power surges billions miles through space but doesnt effect source any way ridiculous character reactions ruin acting too most important mission human history they pack pitt off commercial flight secrecy geriatric my god i actually laughing every few minutes if fantasy scifi fine but seemed want realistic baah space 1999 more realistic than end you have ask what point how you not up 3 counts manslaughter gets 4 stars visuals only,9
Ad Astra,let me begin saying im being generous my rating 2 stars movie disappointment so many levels science completely wrong there were elements cinematography overall visuals deserve some credit but apart movie left much desired,3
Ad Astra,fan space movies brad pitt i went expecting epic but left disappointed one hand there movies like gravity keep you edge your seat literally gasping breath while 2 hour closeup brads face had very little if anything do space,1
Ad Astra,heres what wrong movie,1
Ad Astra,i could rant,4
Ad Astra,somewhere between unexplained lunar pirates unnecessary killer baboons storyline just fell flat even actor amazing brad pitt could not save movie nothing more than drama about daddy issues setting which just happened space backdrop could easily have been old peoples home wouldnt have mattered,2
Ad Astra,people who have rated film highly wannabe intellectuals who pretending understand deeper psychological meaning just isnt there dont waste your time money one,6
Ad Astra,now im big fan these types films i loved interstellar i loved martian i really enjoyed first man i loved apollo 11 doco film i really liked apollo 13 i even enjoyed sunshine most part,4
Ad Astra,now has been outlined i hated movie ad astra because,9
Ad Astra,spoilers,1
Ad Astra,opening shot brads characters shows earth spinning below looked great but then seconds later you see they fixed antenna locked rotation earth first dozens really obvious poor oversights how about continuity moons gravity once rocket facility everyone marching around earth grav seconds earlier rover based version 2 1969 variant floated almost no gravity influence,2
Ad Astra,stupidity facility moon absolutely huge looked about big downtown vegas but they still driving around open top rovers flying rockets look like last years atlas rocket something,8
Ad Astra,ridiculous plot established requires pitts character fly via moon mars make god damn phone call pathetic sound studio style booth his dad what apparently gain reply so they can locate ship well they knew neptune granted big planet but really phone call ship hasnt been heard 15years something liv donalds characters should not have been film these added nothing just added more frustration underwhelming utilisation their known talents,9
Ad Astra,btw idea you can casually stop midway earth mars check distress call utter crap they had going something like 525000mph get mars 6 days whatever ship said idea they could stop make door call ship had rampant chimpanzees solely there remove captain character then get back up speed pretty far reaching bad acting supporting roles such fumbling copilot who froze during landing my favourite lady check area mars who flapping fingers key board vaguely like 8yr olds play something,2
Ad Astra,hilarious water manhole mars cracked me up wtf why there rope thing grab also base rocket below engines flame pit area there casual electrical box what,2
Ad Astra,everything happened whilst watching movie pulled me closer getting up leaving,9

The Kissing Booth 2,every teen movie sequel netflix has been chewing out somehow follows same tropes introducing new guy weve never seen before talbilb 2 john ambrose shake things up movie progresses main female grows further apart her boyfriend due misunderstandings what have you grows closer 2nd love interest they have undeniably chemistry movie makes you want root them instead her her boyfriend they share kiss you think its done deal she obviously have feelings john ambrosemarco but no hes not one shes love after all female protagonist realises her feelings end cue running towards each other scene clears up misunderstandings its happy ever after all over again john ambrosemarco characters sole purpose sway her feelings end make her realise her feelings peternoah true worth fighting fact noahs film poster not marco made clear start marco never going one elle sigh i really liked him,5
The Kissing Booth 2,what i did like friendship between elle lee its probably best part movies,5
The Kissing Booth 2,i basically predicted entire movie after 10 minutes,5
The Kissing Booth 2,may shocking you but i actually found first movie franchise quite enjoyable however sequel kissing booth loses all its quirky charms which replaced factors makes typical netflix coming age romance movie cliche predictable,8
The Kissing Booth 2,movie what its suppose i wasnt disappointed i had good time while watching might feel bit unreal but its teenager movie its amusing shows sometimes people have hard time communicate but end they manage solve their issues doing think bit better than first fact add other people stories between wasnt all problem me better way there more see instead just focusing lee elle noah i really think people shouldnt bashing movie over bad line wasnt their brightest moment but dont think purpose people just taking way too serious nowadays everyone mocks everything do lot worse so i really dont think there reason bashing movie way,1
The Kissing Booth 2,2 ⭐s,4
The Kissing Booth 2,first one cute because joey jacob were love camera so movie kind magical,10
The Kissing Booth 2,one so bad they were so awkward around each other even phone hard watch their interaction were just too cringy uncomfortable,1
The Kissing Booth 2,plot meh love triangle square done horribly,1
The Kissing Booth 2,2 ⭐s were joey joel they were awesome together they should have gone direction aka best friends lovers would have been much nicer,3
The Kissing Booth 2,script terrible waste time i cant believe netflix even decided waste penny movie if youre planning watching dont acting cringe main couple have no chemistry between two them its just awful all around,1
The Kissing Booth 2,but its better than first its not annoying i still hate elle evans character though screenplay bad incredibly predictable main conflict uninteresting gay subpolt nice because involves characters arent elle but they didnt really find way make work so felt really unnecessary like netflixs usual thing including random gay characters just prove theyre inclusive too guys also why does movie have good vibrations cover play end song way too good trash,2
The Kissing Booth 2,very pleasantly surprised how much i liked movie more than original usually thats not case but acting felt more authentic less cheesy one loved very fun summer flick,8
The Kissing Booth 2,firstly why 2 hours long secondly why bad but ended such cliff hanger,3
The Kissing Booth 2,my advise would give one miss,2
The Kissing Booth 2,first movie already bad enough but i decided give 2nd movie try but unfortunately even worse completely wasted hour my life i can never get back,9
The Kissing Booth 2,i disappointed marco ellie didnt end up together thats,10
The Kissing Booth 2,full cliches devoid plot character development absolutely no message teens movie has nothing offer unless you want take shot every time someone says something cringey does something cringeworthy,10
The Kissing Booth 2,movie just painful watch points why did they have make movie lees girlfriend worst character ever elle doesnt get hot hispanic guy end best way sum movie 2 hours pure pain,10
The Kissing Booth 2,i dont know why so much people reviews so mean about comment about justin biebers disease actually not whole idea sequel but my opinion so i cant change peoples mind i think movie better than first one more interesting acting so much better thing i didnt like elle chose noah over marco i know elle noah so cute together but elle marco had endgame whole time pena there her then she chose noah maybe will more fascinating going more dramatic if she chose marco other than film very good i am going expect kissing booth 3 elles decision,10
The Kissing Booth 2,i wasnt sure if i going like one i know its based off book 2 beth reekles i know critics wont agree me but seemed slightly more mature its ya based obviously dont expect adult tale still maintained spirit first one dont believe me watch no spoilers review,10
The Kissing Booth 2,i didnt like first one very much but watched second one anyway my fault i guess i hoped would better but dumb too long over 2 hours very predictable there also possibly cringiest sentence ever uttered romcom ever ill probably still watch 3rd one when comes out but only because i really hope elle lee will final realise how perfect they together they have best chemistry far,1
The Kissing Booth 2,wasted 25 hrs nothing first you cant how stupid elle evans character marco totally helped her achievements still she ditched him returned back noah what writer thinking marco should have been paired end i think netflix did keep franchise alive part 3,7
Knives Out,nothing typical about everything beautifully done movie story flow scenario everything i highly recommend mystery lovers anyone who wants watch good movie,9
Knives Out,what excellent film,8
Knives Out,definitely feels like film he destined make writing slick hell sublime performances most notably daniel craig who brings his agame wonderfully charismatic turn superb editing wonderfully atmospheric music all tied together masterful direction will probably among most fun you have theatre year fans agatha christie old murder mystery stories will have plenty love here nostalgically entertaining time,9
Knives Out,knives out really classic story its kind set modern day daniel craig even playing very clear hercule poirot type character theres bit more humor selfawareness than lot those classic stories but never degree takes away twists mysteries there some good twists fact one biggest mysteries revealed midway through movie which actually led me check time thinking damn we near end already but nope they were just taking movie left turn albuquerque i did not anticipate changed course whole thing johnson has constructed great mystery spirit classics fun too how many twists there without ever feeling overdone way also you can predict few twists but not another so have fun feeling smart still feel surprised others its just classic fun film its type,8
Knives Out,exception my wife daughter possibly my mother agatha christie woman whom i love most planet she truly most gifted brilliant fiction writer who ever lived rejoices me see her work still inspires other writers filmmakers nowadays more than forty years after she passed away there still many adaptations her original work but knives out writerdirector rian johnson attempts something entirely different its abundantly clear johnson inspired all christies typical trademarks hobbyhorses he pays tribute her most legendary characters favorite settings but plot knives out entirely new scripted directly screen good oldfashioned murder mysterywhodunit set enormous mansion wealthy family full eccentric people each whom have dirty little secrets convoluted plot twists continuous red herrings practically make impossible guess along fabulous allknowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling clues,8
Knives Out,daniel craig downright terrific benoit blanc private detective bizarre accent weird oneliners hired someone anonymous dig deeper into strange sudden death patriarch harlan thrombey looks like suicide but literally every greedy member harlans bloodline had motive killing also delightful agatha christie tradition plot even thickens after reading will would shame reveal too much about plot but rest assured refreshing inventive compelling well humorous complex but simultaneously lightheaded 200 entertaining cast phenomenal craig clearly enjoyed depicting heroic protagonist complete opposite his james bond character thrombey family exclusively exists great talents including jamie lee curtis michael shannon toni colette christopher plummer don johnson knives out perhaps slightly too long but never tedious very welldirected rian johnson who honestly doesnt deserve all hatred disappointed star wars geeks,10
Knives Out,fan mysteries sherlock holmes poirot columbo monk psychetc i thrilled see someone making classic style whodunnitand cast figure you cant go wrong well i enjoyed while cast all have time shine daniel craig his southern drawl especially ana de armas steal show anyone keeping away because they hated last jedii agree my least favourite all star wars films but well written film well acted i can only hope will inspire others reinvigorate murder mystery genre,6
Knives Out,best movie year love everything about what im seeing some trolls still cant get over tlj now those have give 1 well thats fair but have some reasons why not just bc its rian johnson like stop its childish,9
Knives Out,i have read many glowing reviews film i honestly dont get yes there were some very funny entertaining parts very good ensemble cast daneil craig does his best kevin spacey frank underwood impression but beyond i found cast woefully underused jamie lee curtis don johnson etc i expected jamie lee play major role but she seemed more like window dressing she also daughter appeared have no real motive murder so real crime here her underuse 12 members family had no motive mentioned then when murder revealed half way point clear martha did not really do being set up chris evans conveniently shows up halfway point lines so reveal most part painfuly obvious least most giveaways were pretty obvious like granny saying random youre back again comment how dogs barked only certain people mention slayer law very very obvious i understand parody sleuth genre but shouldnt there least some surprises,5
Knives Out,nor do i believe commentary our situation today yes there dialogue thrown immigration but nothing new covered here,5
Knives Out,not say bad film daniel craig cast seemed having ball lots kooky things happened but i think better latenite netflix watch,6
Knives Out,i certainly dont see being best year,5
Knives Out,i enjoyed lot clever interesting plausible its logic i enjoyed deception put forth characters i can usually tell where something going genuinely surprised hole hole donut,8
Knives Out,some people might hate politics but i thought gave good dig both sides while still being fairly liberal fox watchers will hate which i can see kind fueling negative reviews,4
Knives Out,what can also fuel negative reviews all positive hype about too much enthusiasm critics can hurt movie sometimes viewers go into theater expecting too much,6
Knives Out,things never live up hype one didnt live up me but i thought still pretty solid entertaining im not sorry i spent some money one,6
Knives Out,good acting awful story social message preachy unnecessary my opinion waste great location intersting characters,6
Knives Out,obviously film has sophisticated marketing strategy nothing else would explain high ratings gets i looking forward but unfortunately its just boring dull youll find more charisma excitement daytime soap ana de armas only actor worth watching while film exposes limitations daniel craig chris evans i wouldnt recommend wasting your time,4
Knives Out,im mystery lover have seen read every agatha christie tale i found movie very slow first half second half picked up but again there no deep mystery whodunit nor charm period atmosphere poirot episode which i can watch over over thank you david suchet other main actors lead actress very attractive but vomiting definitely disgusting watch well ridiculously unbelievable i guess funny part some characters had been under sunlamp too many times smoked way too often looked weatherbeaten did not like sucking cigars constantly last part more entertaining finally there rapidfire conclusion thank lord agree daniel craig southern accent just super annoying great grandmother bored me after first moments her being silent odd hat over over moved pretty slowly me times i guess im minority one im not saying terrible but not great movie me,4
Knives Out,movie meh but mr craigs voice just stupidily wrong,2
Knives Out,highly recommend movie quarantine viewing✨👌🏻,8
Knives Out,being middle aged englishman ive been brought up diet murder mystery stories many respects ive been spoilt when stories have translated book screen production value almost always secondary good conjunct story i very excited having read reviews seemingly case knives out i would getting rare trinity good story good actors good production certainly has two three unfortunately film thinks its cleverer than its simply story privileged family their pettiness rather trivial murder mystery chucked contrivance get them all together rian johnson attempts display worst nature privileged minority all subtlety man screaming i am woke top his lungs anybody wholl listen unfortunately subtlety nuance what makes good mystery story you need pay attention so not miss anything film you could miss probably middle third film youd not any less aware whats happening bit shame really,6
Knives Out,i went into film high expectations say least i had heard so many good things about so built up my mind phenomenal murder mystery movie but fell short where do i begin daniel craig has southern accent just does not come across convincing not annoying but not convincing main character film marta potrayed ana de armas has very unbelievable physiological condition which she vomits every time she tells lie i mean come people vomiting tool used multiple times throughout film figure out truth about some other characters story lets just say she vomits excessively until credits start roll,4
Knives Out,now part film really upset me big reveal end revealed end detective benoit blanc knew about blood stain martas shoe whole time biggest issue reveal why he didnt ask her about he would have known her involvment murder whole time why didnt he get blood spot her shoe tested would have easily put her room harlan when he died,6
Knives Out,overall movie entertaining up until we revealed what happened between marta harlan once i found out how harlan died i started lose interest basically lost mystery quality once happened story went flat after but then took off when new developments started happen reason i give movie 610 because i able figure out things about story right away which left me disappointed blood spot made me question majority movie wasnt bad watch but i dont think i will watching again,4
Palm Springs,films revolve around characters repeating same day over over again has grown very tired my mind groundhog day perfected really wasnt until more recently edge tomorrow i really found film seemed stand out among rest well im glad i can now add palm springs list films put clever spin concept film originally supposed play more film festivals around world eventually receive theatrical release but things being way they hulu has now released although may film thats hard find some right now heres why palm springs one very best movies come out bare year 2020 so far,9
Palm Springs,nyles andy samberg sarah cristin milioti find themselves sort bonding over fact they both really dont want wedding theyre hes date someone who cheats him she sister bride who clearly has many issues stumbling across strange cave after wedding they both find themselves caught time loop has them reliving same day over over again certain things revealed about each these characters add lot more depth story i found myself incredibly engaged beginning end,9
Palm Springs,where film shines most fact completely commits whole time loop concept even giving few winks audience never once makes any huge mistakes logically which felt refreshing especially ways would subvert expectations most importantly way they choose conclude story way palm springs wraps up very entertaining emotionally earned finale now i feel like i say about lot movies focus so much their time very few characters but i truly mean if samberg milioti didnt have any fun chemistry together film wouldve been disaster probably most laid back comfortable ive ever seen andy samberg film made entire experience much better,8
Palm Springs,only having written directed few short films documentary before tackling palm springs director max barbakow has honestly blown me away here small budget small number characters small scope film felt much bigger than i can honestly see big future him coming years i will gladly seek out his next project top his stellar work film writer andy siara who also doesnt have huge filmography yet added very funny clever tone whole concept clear performers were very comfortable dialogue because their acting lept off screen just seemed nice mixture everything coming together nicely behind scenes,8
Palm Springs,end palm springs film i very much looking forward but wary due concept itself thankfully one best movies ive seen accomplish concept years im not calling masterpiece any means but fun time loop movie i really couldnt find many issues mere 90 minutes movie flies has just enough clever surprises those who may not have been completely engaged while idea itself has grown tired me movie undeniably hard dislike everything about movie put huge smile my face if isnt what world needs right now i dont know what,8
Palm Springs,palm springs just such good time movie i smiling just about entire runtime andy samberg kills always so did cristin milioti they both extremely likeable have great chemistry together,8
Palm Springs,i liked happy death day lot i am very much not unhappy trend groundhog day genre movies now my favorite one its so inventive its story i couldnt predict what gonna happen nearly any point so many clever twists story could get tiresome quickly if not done right,9
Palm Springs,props casting connor omalley jenna friedman smaller parts they both rule minionsquad,9
Palm Springs,greatly enjoyable fun movie i would recommend just about anyone watch,10
Palm Springs,i expecting conventional romcom where guy meets girl but one has little twist its smartfunny well written some shots gorgeous very wholesome its fresh take type genre,8
Palm Springs,palm springs one those infinite timeloop situations you might have heard about palm springs romcom about nyles andy samberg sarah cristin milioti two wedding guests stuck timeloop forced relive same day over over again samberg milioti great together nyles sarah cgi may not have been great but didnt take away many laughs i had during movie palm springs great movie if you havent yet watched watch,9
Palm Springs,good thing about movie doesnt last long has story beautiful message you will laugh i promise,9
Palm Springs,i flipping through hulu one night saw movie pop up i saw andy sanberg cute chick himym i thought hey maybe itll good chuckle if not eh who cares but perfect late night gem i love coming across movies shows i genuinely like accident no expectations going,8
Palm Springs,groundhog day gave us some pretty realistic scenarios about life but still bill murray grumpy we saw beginning his characters curse here we dont we meet andy aka nyles when he has already lived same day years have had made peace cristin aka sarah other hand new starts out grumpy but becomes adventurous one,8
Palm Springs,jk simmons also beautiful his character although short storyline they took groundhog day added some stoner existencial crisis type feels added beautiful romantic angle appropriate cinematography movie works multiple levels weekend watch romantic watch fun watch although there some explicit scenes but all they just add overall amusement,6
Palm Springs,opened bang sundance surely worth watch,9
Palm Springs,cheers,4
Palm Springs,i really wasnt expecting ton movie i expected pretty decent romantic comedy i also love andy so i excited give shot but wow i very very pleasantly surprised i literally started over immediately after finishing cause i liked so much completely not what i expecting but i thoroughly enjoyed movie i laughed out loud multiple times story completely amazing my opinion highly recommend if youre wanting quirky comedy but also has very cute moments loved i hope gets recognition deserves,3
Palm Springs,movie utterly wonderful its heartfelt romantic real topical made me think laugh cry,7
Palm Springs,groundhog day setup may seem stale but they get so many fresh ideas out concept solidifies film future cult classic,5
Palm Springs,i never really samberg fan i am now,5
Palm Springs,palm springs flat out hilarious comedy story itself has been done before some have been great groundhog day edge tomorrow etc but adam samberg makes one better ones if you dont find movie funny then something wrong you give chance you will not disappointed,8
Palm Springs,im not gonna spoil anything say anything else about movie if youve watched trailer your just thinking yourself oh another groundhog day movie goes beyond what intended leaves you laughing feeling better than before you watched highly recommended,7
Palm Springs,thought i not rom com type but flick takes cake such refreshing original premise bombshell ending,8
Palm Springs,time loop shtick has been done number times but new film takes puts great romantic comedy spin andy samberg cristin milioti great their chemistry off walls watch great time,7
Extraction,finally netflix has finally produced action movie fast pace chris hemsworth does not disappoint all,8
Extraction,action scenes really good close combat extremely long shots tight spaces sometimes has shooter video game feel hemsworth stunt team really showed their skills movie really more about close combat scenes than crazy hollywood stunts la mission impossible other than all story already title which fine type movie actor who played boy wonderful casting choice he carrying whole emotion story well seeing more him other characters were not drawn out movie not everyone not well rounded its all action no story i personally enjoyed though i recommend viewers like close combat action martial arts movies,7
Extraction,extraction fast vicious simple death count thats approaching john wick 3 levels bullet ballet movie hardly pauses breath,8
Extraction,chris hemsworth excellent haunted mercenary tyler rake very physical role hemsworth delivers spades,9
Extraction,8 out 10,7
Extraction,tyler rake chris hemsworth tasked extracting son druglord amids allout drug war battling hostiles troubled past along way,7
Extraction,thank you jon wick upping game action films extraction excels its action set pieces long gorgeous takes brutally grounded fight scenes showcase vicious nature warfare hemsworth carries entire film his shoulders has daunting task elevating paper thin narrative acceptable level thankfully he succeeds thor can act darn film he proves yet again,6
Extraction,like jon wick before him seeing hemsworth kicking ass amazingly choreographed fight scenes exhilarating film unapologetically honest its depiction violence its consequences riding fantastic sound design every impact bullet wound car crash pulls you deeper deeper film,7
Extraction,negative reviews have focused alleged shortfall depth plot really most action movies out there how many have plausible plot least movie plot plausible action obviously stretch but those critics railing movie forget what movie supposed all about entertainment its not real life documentary not ensemble boring drama piece when comes whambang entertainment movie delivers all cylinders movie probably more analogous version masterful raid than oscar drama piece live watch enjoy movie will keep you glued though squeamish may need take break,9
Extraction,im not much writer so ill keep review short,8
Extraction,plot nothing new but interesting enough however chris hemsworth knocks out park his performance i really didnt expect him but he awesome,9
Extraction,action scenes great some camera work filming techniques fantastic,10
Extraction,film 610 but i gave 710 action scenes hemsworths performance,7
Extraction,world currently minus new films get fresh one delivered us via netflix much needed treat im glad report extraction worth wait isnt flawless movie but certainly has some good things going action sequences were probably highlight film me im not usually someone who appreciates even notices good action sequences but i did film which says something there one sequence really blew me away oneshot sequence goes quite some time has some amazing ingenuity behind definitely highlight film,5
Extraction,chris hemsworth right home role he doesnt have do lot speaking can just let his actions speak themselves some stunt work film would not have been easy when he required slow things down have some dialogue odd scene he does so adequately,6
Extraction,film surprised me just how violent willing times especially scenes involving children there were couple time where i thought theyre not going do they then sure enough they did very serious film well very little if any i can think humour whatsoever makes appearance,9
Extraction,film does get little tedious towards end you can only watch so many people getting shot without becoming numb little bored also film opens shot near end film doesnt work though because there no intrigue behind one few poor choices otherwise very good film made however i would recommend giving one watch,7
Extraction,entire movie filled close combat shots its great someone who likes lot actions but someone like who looks story movies i had hard time trying grasp movie literally shows poor country like bangladesh lost thousands its elite force general dispersed entire city just support gangster save his kidnapped boy escaping looks like bangladesh went into entire war help gangster no matter what just leave logic aside you can enjoy movie fast paced action packed video game,8
Extraction,i am bangladeshi but i know movie not made our culture but hindi songs go house house bangladesh what awkward thing then writing hindi street hindi pronunciation every word what these learning kolkata if dhaka named then situation job director team check select well they have lost completely but actions movie were extraordinary chris randeep have done great jobi know action movie doesnt represent culture but movie criticized its lack analysis director team little better analysis needed because here names russo brothers involved i love russo brothers chris my thor so much,7
Extraction,impressive camera work action sequence all actors did great job making film very entertaining fight scenes great knife fights authentic shoot out exhilarating i guess my only critic plot perhaps different twist about who boy would have made more interesting but nevertheless awesome action film overall again hats off camera work fantastic job,8
Extraction,now its not greate movie nor bad movie its somewhere between i mean stunt work really really great protagonist does have his moments weakness has kind action you come expect action movies today one man against whole world but i bet there someone working movie had millitary expirience one rare movies which guy actually checks see if gun has bullets when he steals actually counting bullets magazine having empty gun chamber yes movie has poor cgi too much yellow color grading unrealistic shooting fighting scenes but still has its moments actual care character even though its not developed,7
Extraction,thoroughly enjoyed film weak storyline but its totally forgiven because its brilliant action camera work thing beauty youre glued car chases fights point where you feel you should smelling exhaust fumes if you dont dodge out way youre going get smack mouth shot director could do james bond film no problem its got rawness action thats needed,5
Extraction,just good solid action flick hemsworth does great job well directed,9
Extraction,want play drinking game thatll get you wasted fast read through user reviews do shot every time some bangladeshi leaves one star review cries about portrayal their country ive been there movie flattering if anything,7
Greyhound,i served destroyer during korean war movie really captured excitement being bridge during convoy duty,9
Greyhound,having served cold war both destroyer submarine i found story contrasting tensions between both worlds action shown bridge cic decks greyhound which btw slang term destroyers those who serve them hanks subtly conveys ache leaving loved one behind her presence him during battle he his crew feel presence subs stalking surface ships deaths sailors both above below icy water there no perfect rendering combat film but repeated commands protocols between naval personnel vessels accurate enough convey sense proper urgency story compressing roughly 48 tense hours into 2 hour film doesnt give much time absorb all thats happening thats point training subsequent reactions shape story faces bridge crew they watch captain follow his orders which he does not explain about relationships between combatants among ships convoy between us british allies film enemy below das boot make reasonable trilogy weekend marathon enjoy story either technical relational view you see fit,9
Greyhound,spectacle dramatization no movie allowed me experience ww2 naval combat without bombast usual action movie felt realistic decent amount suspense glimpse through eyes captain,7
Greyhound,funny reading other reviews what encouraged me write mine most low scoring reviews complain about poor character development thin plot lines weve had 80 years movies giving us lots historical detail real imaginary characters development simple convoluted plot lines world war ii era movie didnt really need lot tell story trying tell if youre paying attention you can see characters develop story told you can see scared people gather their courage dedicated loyal people take one team dedicated captain who will change out his service shoes bloodied days constant wear into slippers his girl friend gave him gift,8
Greyhound,there plenty movies have tried give you complex stories multiple plot lines lots character development only fail perhaps try make up form some action scenes movie never about action first foremost what drives you learn about characters through course events action movie great apple tv but probably would not have been great theatrical release,9
Greyhound,movie about procedure command innately more complex task than more common episodic approach buries procedural reality under mask plot character but film pulls off largely not shying away task,8
Greyhound,guess what naval warfare especially sort highly asymmetric warfare shown here doesnt really revolve around captain demanding more speed while engineer says she canna take if youre looking movie thats truly respectful labours sacrifices made battle atlantic then fitting tribute,5
Greyhound,dont expect character movie dont expect spend time below decks exploring usual stereotypes movie seen through eyes captain captain alone i can think very few other films dare depict loneliness command quite so clearly theres little time thought theres no time process even truly grasp horrors they encounter something which forms one roots ptsd what there fight,8
Greyhound,fight relentless deeply technical weve become used fight scenes carrying few bits technical gibberish followed some visceral personalised action theres no gibberish film latter consists captain cutting his feet broken glass movie like mind captain consumed intricate technical personal demands required hunt down submarine time clearly aim here movie has succeeded admirably showing particular aspect type warfare not common way stage war movie but its worth doing well few occasions movie achieves its goal,6
Greyhound,reviews show many come looking something more conventional end up missing point which shame,9
Greyhound,honestly i decided write review counter some more trivial reviews found thread try present objective perspective film,10
Greyhound,firstly dialogue movie typical movie depicting world war ii naval life accurate time period do not watch film if you expect anything other than period correct naval terminology constant passing orders between captain crew you not going satisfied movie ninety percent dialogue movie relates business conducting asymmetrical naval combat highspeed situation way too short have grand introspective extrospective expose psychology warfare ones place world sadly short length film prevents any adequate amount time dedicated forging interesting dynamic characters complex plot villain somewhat pointless if anything director should have lengthened film expound upon narrative bring our cautious somewhat hesitant captain life pick handful critical sailors develop relationship within 80minute time constraint,6
Greyhound,secondly there better movies shows depict battle atlantic which brings me my second point if anything film should have been broken into miniseries like das boot full feature series like band brothers pacific had directors decided embark upon route we could have had significantly stronger plot been able identify characters more empathetic way former united states navy sailor i felt right home style accuracy briskness which film endeavored portray however i did not find myself overly attached any featured characters fact film attempts show us we should feel shocked saddened disheartened plight these sailors however without any indepth character development i found difficult me feel any more than somewhat saddened time i did experience emotion movie moved onto another chaotic event reflecting upon movie now maybe point plot maybe film tries showcase chaos battle does not grant us moment emotional expression aside adrenaline rush combat lifethreatening event any case if you looking significant character development grander view battle atlantic large certainly not film you,5
Greyhound,lastly i do not any capacity feel like i wasted hour half my life like some other viewers felt me nostalgic trip back into old life i long forgotten i enjoyed every minute film despite its shortcomings has tom hanks done better certainly did i think he did poor job film absolutely not while my main complaint film could have been significantly longer i am left desire want explore more regards treacherous battle atlantic men all nations who participated,4
Greyhound,overall i pleasantly surprised movie while i felt film could have been produced its own miniseries order develop plot characters better i thoroughly enjoyed my time i am sure i will return again future,3
Greyhound,enjoy,6
Greyhound,good production quite intense very interesting reenactment battle sea although i am not sure how realistic accurate those submarines liked fight lot plain sight over water right,5
Greyhound,my main issue like documentary lots battle time but no much human drama no time given develop any characters even make us feel something about these people ships were sinking middle atlantic we never had look horror trying survive even hanks character felt flat few scenes his love interest were rather awkward didnt contribute much one point we were wondering if captain spectrum something,5
Greyhound,still if you fan wwii movies i suggest watch unique perspective battle sea,1
Greyhound,loved authenticity general faithfulness technical side naval warfare me great movie i love seeing small little details how captain commands his vessel every crewman doing their job quick glances cic trying keep track enemy vessels movie didnt need show crewman following captain around repeating every word sonarradar reports but does so adds very nice detail i found great also helped build stress tension everyone under,4
Greyhound,my only complaint movie could have been longer i could definately have watched 3 hour version took slower style das boot other than i recommend movie anyone loves more technical parts warfare especially naval vessels,5
Greyhound,though movie might have been right technical terms somehow did not unleash potential had,8
Greyhound,i felt movie could have been longer better depiction enemy understand details strategy better,1
Greyhound,climax if any not up mark,9
Greyhound,u571 das boot had done better job long time ago,5
